MJWood	As a teacher, why don't I get access to an online library of high quality common resources for use in the classroom? I spend an inordinate amount of time searching for resources which, I feel, should just be there already.	321	x765j7	https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/x765j7/as_a_teacher_why_dont_i_get_access_to_an_online/	106	2022-09-06 09:35:01	education
bats0482	I was just told by my principal that I have to delete a FB post in which my husband and I (both teachers) express our questions and concerns about starting school in Oklahoma next month.	318	hsexbm	https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/hsexbm/i_was_just_told_by_my_principal_that_i_have_to/	81	2020-07-16 18:13:23	education	**Edited to delete the mention of the name of the school district we work for per their request**  These are some of the concerns we have as school teachers in Oklahoma beginning school next month.  I was just on the Covid-19 ward of the hospital and the doctor there highly recommended that my husband and I (both teachers) wear N95 masks to protect ourselves when we return to school, just like other frontline workers. Will frontline worker PPE be provided by (the district) or do we have to purchase our own out of pocket?  Will schools still be required to do tornado, fire, and lock-down drills? They are needed for the safety of all, but students and teachers cannot possibly keep a safe distance from one another in these situations.  Parents often send their children to school sick, which is especially a problem during a normal flu season. We know that Covid-19 does not necessarily present with a fever, so checking temperatures each day, while a great step, isn’t enough. Just like parents send their children to school with the flu so they can pay the rent (and can’t afford to take the child to a doctor in the first place) they will do the same with this deadly virus. What steps is (the district) taking address this issue?  The substitute shortage pre-pandemic was a huge issue. Will teachers be expected to substitute one hour a day as opposed to having a planning period? Can we refuse the request or can we be financially compensated for having to cover other teacher’s classes?  Teachers will inevitably be faced with the Covid-19 deaths of students and co-workers this school year. Will (the district) be providing mental health counseling to employees free of charge? Or will we have to pay for that out of pocket as well?  Will the families of teachers with pre-existing health conditions forced to work in this dangerous environment be financially compensated by (the district) if their life is lost due to contracting Covid-19 while at school?  Will (the district) be financially liable for the hospitalization costs of teachers who contract Covid-19 on the job?  Can (the district) provide free, onsite, Covid-19 testing every 2 weeks?
missylizzy	After working a decade in one of the poorest districts in America, I have 15 tips for teachers.	311	ewz28n	https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/ewz28n/after_working_a_decade_in_one_of_the_poorest/	87	2020-02-01 02:03:06	education	More teachers are leaving the profession than ever before:  https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/things-have-just-gotten-so-bad-why-teachers-in-america-are-leaving-the-classroom-for-good-133358169.html  My first year of teaching, I wanted to commit suicide. This is not an exaggeration. I bought lottery tickets weekly looking for an escape. As you all know, we feel trapped.   If you like your job, that is great, and I will not take away from that. However, this post is for anyone suffering. So let me give you some tips to help you. I also want to note I work in one of the worst states for education, and one of the top 20 poorest districts in the country. Here we go:  **1) Parents are not your enemy:** Teachers are so afraid of parents, but if you establish a good relationship from the beginning, you would be surprised. I always give a small gift to parents at the beginning of the year, and I put them on the Remind app. The gift costs me money, yes, but it is always worth it.   I always, always try to work with parents before referring a student. They always appreciate it! For my tough students, I give weekly updates. I rarely refer students anymore.  Remember, I am in a poor district with a lot of broken homes. But with this approach, I have rarely if ever had a problem. In fact, during my disastrous first year of teaching, I called about 50 parents in a month and fixed my classeoom.  Most parents really have no idea. If they trust you, they will believe you.  Also learn how to do the sandwich method! *Positive, negative, positive. Joshua is an amazing kid, but I am concerned. Here is why. Again, I really love having him.*  http://robdkelly.com/blog/communication/the-sandwich-method-of-feedback/   **2) You can only control your own classroom:** I am saying this as I work on an administrative degree. Unless you have some power in admin, you likely cannot change much outside your classroom. I still make effort, but I realize it is mostly a lost cause unless you have some decent level of leadership in the school. Make your classroom environment everything! Worry about the rest later or when you have energy.   **3) Remember about the crab bucket mentality:** Generally speaking, people are more likely to get jealous when you are doing well than praise you. Do not worry if people like you. Just do what is right, which leads to my next point...  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality  **4) No Child Left Behind (NCLB) mostly destroyed education.** It is now a business, and your colleagues are now competitors. A little jealousy is going to happen, and you will have to expect that under pressure, people normally are not as kind. Data, test scores, and over work are the norm now:  https://educationvotes.nea.org/2015/02/20/educators-share-how-no-child-left-behind-has-affected-their-classroom/  **5) Take a day off: I worked for most of my ten years fearing a day off.** I am angry about that because I moved districts and I had to start from scratch. If you need a day off, take it!!! Your classroom will be fine, and if your kids are out of control, make sure your consequences are ready. I always tell kids I will call parents, and they know I am in now way lying, which also leads to my next point...  **6) Stay true to what you say you are going to do!** Teachers say one thing and do another. Kids do not take them seriously. If you say you are going to write up or call home, do it!!! Do NOT feel sorry. Have some compassion, yes. But kids need rules, boundaries, and structure. Kids think I'm evil at the beginning of the year, but always thank me later when I helped them get back on track through loving discipline. We must set limits with kids, and you are NOT their friend:  https://www.verywellfamily.com/reasons-why-it-is-important-to-set-limits-with-kids-1094884   **7)  Be efficient:** The other day I graded, and I did not spend as much time on simple work habits. They got a 1 if they turned in, and a 0 if they did it.  How many times have I put effort into grading something, only to see it on the floor like trash? You must be efficient and not obsessive. Sometimes you cannot grade everything. You cannot do it all. Do what you need to, and prioritize certain things. I am often honest with kids and tell them I just did not have the time. They never seem to hold it against me. I do data, but I do it in a way that means something to me and my students. Same with everything else! There are ways to cut corners:  https://thecornerstoneforteachers.com/truth-for-teachers-podcast/cant-can-teacher-really-cut-corners/  **8) Be what you want your students to be:** You cannot get mad if they have late work if you procrastinate constantly. You cannot be mad if they are disrespectful if you treat them with disrespect. Model and be who you want them to be. I always admit when I have slacked or not lived up to expectations. I also give students some level of slack when I know they are going through a hard time. Nobody is perfect.  **9) Classroom management is everything:** I now get bored during teaching because of how smoothly my classroom runs. I rarely have discipline issues. They send me the absolute worst kids in the school. After my distrastous first year, I read Harry Wong's The First Days of School and I never looked back. He is right about mostly everything.   https://www.effectiveteaching.com/store/products/books/new-the-first-days-of-school-5th-edition  **10) Positive Behavior Supports and Interventions (PBIS):** Look it up and embrace it. My talk now is 75% positive and 25% negative. When I first began PBIS, it felt unnatural. I challenged myself to give 5 compliments per class. Now my students love me because of how positive I am. It feels completely natural now.   Let's say your class is not listening. My reaction? I find the one kid doing the right thing. I really appreciate Isaac listening to me. They all change their behavior.  I could write an entire different post on this, but for now:  https://www.pbis.org/  **11) Leave work at work and develop a routine:** I work every Sunday to prepare my class for the week. But I never (almost never) do any work after I get off the rest of the week. Find a schedule that works for you, and have boundaries! Most things can wait. If something is urgent, that is different. When I work on Sunday, it means I rarely come in early, and I rarely stay late. However, people still see me as an over-achiever at my school.  **(12) Avoid crusty teachers:** I rarely participate in the constant negativity of teachers. It brings me down. If you want change, have a solution.  **13) You cannot save them all:** DO NOT put your energy into the student who never works. I always tell students I cannot force them to do anything. If they want to sleep and be lazy, give a clear consequence and move on. Prepare them for the real world.  The other day I was acting admin. Teachers were all freaking out about a kid not working, but he was not disturbing the classroom. Their energy on him took away from 25 other kids. Document and move on. I never really care unless it is a complete disruption. These kids realize I will not respond to the negative attention they so desperately crave.  **14) Move if you need to:** If your school is not working out for you, move. It is ok, and you owe them nothing.  **15) Society is mostly broken:** You are not going to change the world, but you can change one student's life. Just caring is almost always enough for most. Remember, consequences are almost gone from education. Kids are looking forward to a harsh world. I treat my classroom as the one hour of the day they have some peace. A teacher once observed me and said it was like being with a family.   I do spend a lot of money on it all, but it is worth it.  Of course I cannot cover everything, but these tips saved me as a teacher.   Ask me literally anything.
saddestmonkey	Thank you teachers!!!	296	ikfnf1	https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/ikfnf1/thank_you_teachers/	17	2020-09-01 07:03:14	education	Every day my band teacher would ask us all to put in the zoom chat how we are feeling from 1-5. 1 is not great, and 5 being amazing! I’ve been putting 1’s and 2’s because I’ve been feeling sad and lonely lately. Since it’s band, I just assumed that he probably didn’t read any of those because the class has 80 students.  However, today when he put us into breakout rooms, he told me that he noticed that I haven’t been feeling my A-game lately, and if I ever needed to talk, I could always stay after class or have a meeting with him. I laughed it off because I didn’t to be a burden on him.   Anyways, just that small interaction of him noticing even though we’re in a huge class just made me feel like there is always someone out there. My parents always laugh whenever I talk about my feelings, and having my teacher saying that they’re here for me, brightened my day so much.   I’m just so grateful for all the teachers out there who care for their students. It’s difficult online, and I thank you for doing your best to connect with your students. Now, I feel like I’m at a solid 3 or 4.

For those who realize how bad things are and but “that’s just the way it is”... I say it’s past time for accepting things because that’s the way it is or that’s how it’s always been done. You don’t like the education system the way it is? Stand with the teachers that have fought to do what they can for your children and are now being put in harms way to provide for your children knowing there is NO WAY to truly keep the students safe enough from this virus or themselves. Stand with the teachers that go to the extra length to make sure they adapt the crappy curriculum so that your child can have the best education they know how to give. Stand with the teachers that, when something terrible happens, adapts to whatever the situation is and does what is needed to provide education while doing their best to keep our kids safe. It’s time. STAND WITH THE TEACHERS!

ChunkyMonkey_00_	A teacher made a spreadsheet tracking covid-19 in schools. She has more than 700 entries (WaPo Article)	283	ibhpb2	https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/ibhpb2/a_teacher_made_a_spreadsheet_tracking_covid19_in/	18	2020-08-17 16:44:53	education	> Alisha Morris usually spends early August preparing lesson plans and getting her classroom set up at Olathe West High School in Olathe, Kan. But this year she was stuck at home, anxiously scrolling through an endless stream of stories about schools that have opened up only to quickly shutter or sends hundreds of students home to quarantine because of exposure to the novel coronavirus.  > “I was feeling overwhelmed by all the articles I was seeing online,” Morris, 29, told The Washington Post. “I really thought I was seeing duplicate articles.”  > To keep track of what was happening in districts across the country, Morris organized the information from each article into a Google spreadsheet.  > “At first I thought it was kind of great that I have something to do now — it can help ease my anxiety and become a purposeful task,” Morris said. “And then it exploded into something pretty overwhelming and pretty depressing.”  > In 10 days, her spreadsheet has gone from 30 entries to more than 700 as of early Monday, each representing a separate school that has been affected by covid-19. Its reach is beyond anything she imagined. What started as a tool for her and her colleagues has swelled into a national resource for hundreds of educators and parents around the country.  > To Morris’s knowledge, it’s the first publicly available database of schools with covid-19 cases, and it shows nearly every state has already had schools affected by the virus.  > “We knew this would happen, and we had tried to make it known that it would happen, but seeing it on paper was, I think, the eye-opening part about it,” Morris said. “It’s just that terrifying moment when you open it up and just keeps scrolling and you’re like: ‘How can there be so many?’ ”  > As the Trump administration urges schools to open, outbreaks continue to befall schools that have started in-person classes. The Cherokee County School District in Georgia has shut down three high schools and sent almost 2,000 people to quarantine. In Nebraska this weekend, the Broken Bow School District canceled classes after three staff members tested positive for covid-19.  > Morris said she didn’t create the document to push a political agenda — she simply wanted to disseminate as much information as possible to educators.  > “My goal is to keep people healthy and save lives and to provide data that can hopefully help people make data-informed decisions for the future of their schools,” Morris said.  > Morris is the theater director at Olathe High School, where her own school district has offered parents the choice of online or in-person classes. She decided her theater classes will be online only in the fall semester. Kansas has seen about 33,600 cases of covid-19 and just over 400 deaths to date.  > On Aug. 7, Morris started plugging school districts and case numbers into a spreadsheet. Two days later, she sent her initial findings to colleagues and her school board members. Soon, she posted the spreadsheet in teacher Facebook groups, which led to an overwhelming response, she said.  > “Many people were very thankful to have that information and equally they were shocked and had no idea what that it was this widespread,” Morris said.  > When people started sending her more articles, she added a link to upload new information. Hundreds of submissions came pouring in. The work became so overwhelming that Morris accepted help from retired teachers, stay-at-home parents, other educators, and even some students from Rutgers University. Now, she has about 35 people updating the spreadsheet.  > “It feels unifying in a time that feels so isolating,” Morris said.  > The document is in such high demand that she switched it from being a live spreadsheet, which has a cap of 100 concurrent visitors on the page, to a published one that updates every five minutes with new data imported by herself or one of the volunteers.  > When her school contract starts on Thursday, she expects she won’t have much more time to dedicate to the spreadsheet. But she wants it to live on as a resource.  > “We’ll do it for as long as we can sustain it,” Morris said, though she’s hoping an individual or an organization with more experience can do something more “official than my grass-roots efforts.”   [Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/17/coronavirus-schools-reopening-teacher-spreadsheet/)  [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQSD9mm5HTXhxAiHabZA6BPUByWBlP5HZ2jfOPEeGZkMB0ZFsmFBL5orqjIq22mjFNZ7n-11ObCylGn/pubhtml?fbclid=IwAR2tJ8yDVehGpxoP97Cco5HYAxoN014opwwm6uYt4s3E2xDr_8u9KF_LlgI#)
vonahn	I am the co-founder of Duolingo, the most popular way to learn languages in the world. Today I’m happy to announce the launch of Duolingo for Schools!	279	2rrqlc	https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/2rrqlc/i_am_the_cofounder_of_duolingo_the_most_popular/	24	2015-01-08 19:01:31	education	Over 60 million people around the world use [Duolingo](http://duolingo.com) to help them learn languages for free. In response to thousands of letters from language teachers and education ministries from governments around the world, I’m happy to announce the launch of [Duolingo for Schools](http://schools.duolingo.com).   Since Duolingo requires no begging for funding from administrations (non-existent in most cases!), many language classrooms in the US and abroad had already begun using it as a technological companion. The governments of Costa Rica and Guatemala, for example, recently started pilots in some of their public schools, where teachers with high English proficiency are scarce.  Some teachers have even restructured their entire curriculum to synch with Duolingo’s. “The gamification really works with the kids and opens up an opportunity for them to reinforce what is taught during instructional time. I am the only foreign language teacher at a school of 750 students. We have been using Duolingo this year, and I'm seeing really novel results,” commented Said Kassem Hamideh, a Spanish High School teacher at Washington High School of IT in Milwaukee.  The launch of Duolingo for Schools means educators will finally have a dashboard to track student progress in a consolidated manner… but that’s just the beginning.   In the near future, [The Dashboard](http://dashboard.duolingo.com) will help teachers understand each student’s learning needs at a level of detail previously impossible.   By tracking patterns across incorrect answers and moments of hesitation, Duolingo can provide insight into each student’s areas of difficulty and provide immediate feedback in order to maximize in-class productivity. The goal is to provide a personalized learning experience to each student and free up teachers’ time to concentrate on difficult concepts, answer questions, and assist students falling behind.  I’m excited about this launch and hope we can have a big impact in the educational system around the world.

TigerMyth	In schools, I think we should probably shift our focus away from Shakespeare and classics to more modern contemporary books such as Fahrenheit 451, 1984 and Brave New World, which have far greater importance to modern-day culture with the dominance of internet rhetoric.	266	n3hgec	https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/n3hgec/in_schools_i_think_we_should_probably_shift_our/	104	2021-05-02 22:19:29	education	I think what I am trying to say is that people, and children especially, lives are filled with so much rhetoric that it is more important to educate using anti-rhetoric books and theories, and philosophy, than necessarily classics (which are of course important).  Edit: I also get that this is based on my personal experiences within education in the UK system so will obviously differ quite a bit, but I love the discourse!  Edit: Ok Final Edit: My point is we need more relevant books to help younger people understand and defend themselves against rhetoric, which is everywhere! Rhetoric has always existed but usually within earshot of the person listening. Now people can hear it on their phone in their bedrooms. That is all I am saying.

Why should public school employees have to make 120 payments in order to get their student loans forgiven when they might ALSO get shot on the job?  Public school employees often have the same requirements for post-secondary education as people in much higher-paying private sector positions, frequently work harder, and are responsible for growing the skills necessary for every other career.   Once a public school employee has worked for 120-240 months in the position, depending on the poverty level of the schools in which they worked and regardless of how many loan payments they have made, their entire student loan balance should be forgiven in gratitude for their service in public education.  https://www.change.org/p/cancel-all-loans-for-public-school-employees?recruiter=5489041&recruited_by_id=b960efd0-72cd-0130-e79b-3c764e049b13&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=petition_dashboard

The original and unedited form of this post cited to several media appearances and interviews that Vladimir Putin, Sergei Lavrov, Dmitry Peskov and others gave, as well as other examples of disinformation and misinformation from Russian media preceding Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.    I originally submitted on December 8, 2021, before Reddit Admins decided to [censor all Russian domains, in response to Putin's invasion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/t66l5f/reddit_blocked_all_domains_under_russian_cctld_ru/).  Sadly and unsurprisingly, Reddit's decision to censor Russian domains failed to achieve the effect it intended.  This post is one such example.  Here, I focused significantly on identifying and dispelling the disinformation, misinformation and other false narratives of Vladimir Putin's government preceding Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.    While I have had no choice but to remove links to Russian domains, unedited text of my December 8, 2021 post follows:  ********** **********  After the USSR's dissolution, the administrations of [George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2014/12/04/the-budapest-memorandum-and-u-s-obligations/) undertook considerable diplomatic efforts to prevent the Soviet Union's collapse from increasing nuclear proliferation.  At that time, Ukraine inherited the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world: at least 1,900 strategic nuclear weapons.  Then, the sole threat to Ukraine was the Russian Federation.  Not NATO or the United States.   ### Ukraine's Nuclear Disarmament in Exchange for NATO-member's Assurances of Security  In exchange for Ukraine's agreement to disarm, the United States brokered a deal between Ukraine and Russia known now as the [Budapest Memorandum](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_1994_1399.pdf).  Parties to the Budapest Memorandum were Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation and the United States.  The obligations were for Russia and others to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as the borders were currently drawn.  The teeth were NATO's, even if implicitly.    Though not a formal defense pact between NATO and Ukraine, the sole reason Ukraine agreed to disarm was based on the United States' and other NATO members' readiness to provide security assurances.  So, if the agreement was ever violated, NATO (and particularly the United States, who brokered the deal) would have to enforce it --- because there was no one else.  Then as now, Ukraine lacked any viable defense against the Russian military --- other than that nuclear arsenal, which it gave up in reliance on the word of the United States.    But at the time, Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin were of the belief that a new era of friendship between the United States and Russia had materialized and would represent the future of US-Russian bilateral relations.  Vladimir Putin has since falsely claimed that a component of those negotiations was something like an implied covenant that NATO would not expand.  George H. W. Bush made no such concessions.  Nor did Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright or anyone else.    ### Why Ukraine Matters  #### Nuclear Proliferation  If Russia invades Ukraine, Iran's nuclear hardliners will be emboldened and Iran may never dismantle its nuclear weapons program.  Consider Libya. Recall that Libya voluntarily dismantled its nuclear program.    * Gaddafi stated repeatedly that the Administration of George W. Bush, the Blair government, etc. leaned on him to advise Iran and North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons programs too --- which he did, at their behest.   * Libya further revealed the extent of its WMD program, allowed Russian, American and British officials to visit 10 previously unknown nuclear sites and dozens of Libyan laboratories and military factories to search for evidence of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities and for chemical and missile programs --- which they found. The Islamic world excoriated Gaddafi for doing so.   * Gaddafi disarmed in exchange for essentially nothing.  Gaddafi, however, believed the George W. Bush Administration was negotiating in good faith --- which they were.    Gaddafi's mistake wasn't trusting the administration of George W. Bush; it was assuming Bush held the same kind of power he held in Libya.  More specifically, the problem was Hillary Clinton.   As Obama's Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton failed at every step.  And in what may well prove to be one of the most stunning failures in the history of American foreign policy, Clinton orchestrated the events and circumstances that led to Gaddafi's fall.  Not only did she misread the Arab Spring.  She mislead the Obama administration as a result.    In so doing, Clinton failed to anticipate the obvious implications to far more compelling foreign policy objectives: Iran and North Korea, the United States' accounts of concern on nuclear proliferation.  Clinton's incompetence essentially destroyed the United States's credibility before its adversaries.  And she had the audacity to proclaim this a success.  Iran obviously took note (and North Korea almost certainly did as well).  Iran saw any nuclear talks with the Obama administration through the lens of what Hillary Clinton did to Gaddafi in Libya in and before 2011, despite Gaddafi's agreement with Bush on Libya's nuclear program.  Yet by some act of providence, Iran nevertheless negotiated with the Obama team and a deal was reached in 2015.  By all counts, the Obama team struck the best deal that could be had then.  It was good while it lasted.    Iran now sees any nuclear talks with the Biden administration, through the lens of what Donald Trump did to the JCPOA after he was elected and what Clinton did to Gaddafi.  Trump's political blunder was less worse than what happened in Libya.  Two critical blows to American credibility on the world stage on nuclear disarmament.    Now, what Putin may be preparing to do in Ukraine would be far worse.  What is on the line is not just American credibility with Iran in its dealings during nuclear disarmament talks, but America's credibility as a party to lead those negotiations in the first place.  After all, what possible incentive does Iran have to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program, when it is unwilling to defend a country that detrimentally relied on the United States' prior security assurances?  Of what value is America's present word that it won't invade, should circumstances change in a future administration?  Just exactly how high would the costs be, if Iran defied the United States under Joe Biden's leadership?    This was not inevitable, but lamentations over what might have been in alternative futures is unproductive.  The question now is how we move forward in view of what is at risk.    #### Taiwan  If Russia invades Ukraine and the United States fails to provide a credible military response, China will be far more likely to invade Taiwan.    ##### Consider Georgia  The administration of George W. Bush turned a blind eye when Russian forces advanced on Georgian territory in 2008, in violation of Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.  Putin invaded Georgia was because Mikheil Saakashvili (former Georgian president) was actively pursuing Georgia's induction into NATO.  Georgia joining NATO would have laid a pathway to Ukraine's eventual NATO membership.  To Putin, this was unacceptable.    At that time, Bush was forced to choose between the long-term and more abstract threat to American interests in the Caucuses and the imminent threat to American interests arising from his engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan.  On the one hand, Georgia did not dismantle a nuclear program in detrimental reliance on American security promises.  On the other, Georgia, like Ukraine, had been engaged in long-standing talks with Washington and other stakeholders for NATO ascension/membership since the end of the Cold War.  Those talks were happening concurrently and their pathway was tied, even if informally.    Yet, Bush needed access to Russian airspace in order to continue to prosecute the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he would have lost if he questioned Putin's invasion of Georgia.  Iraq and Afghanistan were more important than Georgia to Bush then (which given the options on his plate, was probably the right call in the short-term).  So Putin got away with it.    ##### Consider Crimea and Eastern Ukraine  Putin further exploited the United States's military overextension in and around 2014, by sending ununiformed Spetsnaz troops into and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, following Viktor Yanukovych's (former Ukrainian president, disgraced Russian stool-pigeon) fleeing for Moscow in the wake of Maidan.    Putin denied essentially every aspect of his operations in and throughout Eastern Ukraine and Crimea until he was confronted with satellite photos of Russian military caravans entering Ukraine with BUK surface-to-air missiles.  But that denial gave Obama the latitude ignore, and then do almost nothing to defend Ukraine or enforce the Budapest Memorandum's covenants in the face of Russian violations.  Which is exactly what happened.  By then, the vote to join Russia had already happened in Ukraine, and Putin replicated his siege of Georgia on a larger scale.  Like Bush with Georgia, other problems were in the forefront of Obama's mind, and Obama needed Putin's ongoing cooperation in and over Syria and in dealing with ISIS.  Putin got away with it again.   Now, China wonders what it might get away with.  It is no coincidence that the Chinese Communist Party's rhetoric has escalated acutely over Taiwan since Biden was elected.  Nor is it a coincidence that China is repeatedly engaging in acts of military aggression in and around Taiwan, its airspace and territorial waters.  These developments are unsurprising, given the nearly complete lack of resistance from Washington and NATO over Ukraine (and Georgia).  In addition, China views this strategic opening in the context of Biden's disgraced withdrawal from Afghanistan.    In view of Putin's unanswered actions in Ukraine, China recognizes that the Biden administration lacks the will and political capital needed to offer a credible defense of Taiwan.  Note, of course, that the stakes for Ukraine and Taiwan are different, but both are compelling.  For example, in Ukraine, the stakes are nuclear proliferation whereas in Taiwan, the stakes are semiconductor strategic access.  Yet from China's perspective, if the Biden administration is willing to let Russia take Ukraine (even more so than prior administrations already have) or reduce that country to a fragmented and failed state, to prevent it from joining NATO, then there is no will whatsoever in Washington to defend Taiwan.  Especially when that defense would be leveraged against a more powerful force where the United States has profoundly more to lose.  ### Invading Ukraine: Actions Vs. Words  Several within the Republican party are arguing that Putin has no intention of invading Ukraine.  Instead, they explain Putin's troop-massing as a defensive measure to protect Russia's borders in response to Ukrainian troop movement inside Ukraine.  * This is consistent with reports from, among others, Russian media who frame Putin's actions as purely defensive, in response to Ukraine's creation of threats to the security of Russia.   * Putin himself has made the same case, in recent interviews, where he argues that Russia has concerns relating to Ukrainian military exercises which he characterizes as unplanned.    Putin's response is the military equivalent of a neighbor saying I saw you lighting candles inside your house without letting me know, so because I am concerned you might light another, I have summoned a fleet of fire trucks and have jumbo jets at the ready to drop fire retardant on everything around you, just in case you should decide to light others.  The idea that Ukraine could or would invade Russia is absurd.  And history counsels otherwise, including in view of what Saakashvili faced from Putin in Georgia during 2008.    Other events must also be considered for context.  For example, Russian media continue to prime the Russian people with ideas like NATO will not stand up for Ukraine and the only thing that stands between the Russian Military and Kiev is the unreliable words of Jens Stoltenberg (Alliance Secretary General for NATO) while the White House has done nothing than send Antony Blinken.  After all, Canada has proven a [more robust and reliable ally](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-canada-considers-boosting-military-aid-to-ukraine-as-russia-amasses/) than Washington, under Joe Biden.  Additionally, Sergei Lavrov continues to make the case that Moscow rejects transforming Ukraine into a NATO military foothold, as reported by Kremlin-backed RT.  In the next breath, Lavrov is making innuendo about Mikheil Saakashvili and Georgia in 2008 --- the last such defensive measure taken by Putin.  The connection may not be obvious to some audiences, but what [happened in 2008 foretold](https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-russia-invaded-georgia-1533682576) the next decade and a half of Putin's military adventurism:  > Long before its conventional assault on Georgia, Russia openly backed separatist militants, launched cyberattacks, and used disinformation to meddle in the internal affairs of sovereign states. Initial intelligence reports of Russian forces entering Georgian territory didn’t even cause enough concern to order Georgian military officials back from their holidays. Though Moscow had long attempted to thwart Georgia’s turn to the West, Russia had not launched a conventional military attack on a neighboring country since it invaded Afghanistan in 1979. >  > But in August 2008, under the auspices of “securing” the separatist enclave, Russia invaded [Georgia]. To say the Kremlin uses disproportionate force is an understatement: Russia bombed Georgian positions with more than 200 aircraft, while the Georgian air force had fewer than a dozen combat aircraft in service. Some 80,000 Russian land troops deployed to Georgia; our entire army stood at less than 30,000. >  > Yet some in the West, like then-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, faulted Georgia. Leaving aside the practical impossibility of Georgia attacking a nuclear power 100 times its size, the entirety of the conflict took place on internationally recognized Georgian territory. The Kremlin’s claim that its land forces mobilized overnight in response to an emergency was absurd. Such an onslaught required careful preparation, especially given the mountainous terrain of the Russian-Georgian border.  The reason Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 was because he recognized there was no will in the West to defend that region from the Russian army.  Putin correctly recognized that Bush was over-extended in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is why he recognized his narrow window of opportunity to act and did so before it closed.  That was very much a fortune favors the bold type risk that paid off.  ### Biden's Most Significant Challenge Yet  #### Iterative Escalation  Putin's strategy here is one of iterative escalation. Based on his actions --- which speak much louder than his words --- Putin hasn't decided whether to invade fully yet or not.  By mounting troops on Putin's border, Putin is trying to gain more information about the risks to his interests that are involved.    A credible response from the United States alone will keep the Russian army out of Ukraine. Anything less than that, and this will be a repeat of history --- just like with Georgia in 2008.  Whether he will face such a response is what Putin is trying to figure out now.  When I say credible response, I don't mean just the threat of sanctions.  I mean the threat of an overwhelming military response by the United States and allied powers. If Putin thinks he can take Ukraine without bearing those costs, he will absolutely do so.    A credible response is not simply economic sanctions or other diplomatic maneuvering like the Obama administration undertook during and after 2014.  Those sanctions had some impact, but they did not change policy.    #### Strength of Biden's Hand  Biden's hand is weaker than Obama's in 2014, because Obama had more political leverage then.  The United Kingdom will follow Washington but will not act alone.    Poland will come to the United States' aid but they simply lack the military capability to deliver.    Germany is not going to cancel Nord Stream 2 or future gas supply contracts with Russia over Russia's having invading Ukraine, and will avoid substantive engagement in the conflict at all costs. Condemnation alone will be the likely limit of Germany's responsive action. Note as well that however harsh Blinken's proposed sanctions may be, their impact will almost certainly be limited by Germany, in view of their their reliance on Russia for energy.    France will bark (because it does not depend on Moscow for gas in the winter) but not bite, as Russia's actions do not implicate France's direct interests.  Italy will be predictably silent, or side with Russia just as Berlusconi did when Putin seized Georgia in 2008.    In fact, the only European countries who will stand up for what is proper are those who could be next: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.   Outside of there, Biden will have to depend on Canada and Australia --- each, unlikely bets given their self-inflicted wounds over COVID.  So the only way any attempt at peaceful negotiations can succeed is in the presence of the credible threat of military confrontation as the alternative. Otherwise, politics will be continued by other means.    ### Blood in the Water  The writing is on the wall, and the pattern mirrors what happened in 2008.  * Then, Bush was preoccupied with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia deployed 80,000 Russian land troops to fight an army that stood less than 30,000 in response to imagined provocation and Putin calculated NATO would not defend Georgia.  And he was right, because Bush did nothing even though his hands then were not even remotely as tied as Biden's are now.  * Now, Biden is preoccupied with his catastrophic failure in Afghanistan, COVID and a rising China, Putin has deployed as many troops as comprise nearly the entire (and arguably less competent, less well supplied and less well trained) Ukrainian army and Putin has calculated that Joe Biden will not defend Ukraine.  And he may well be right again for many of the same reasons he was right in 2008.  I don't want war and hope it can be avoided.  But I have every expectation that if Russia invades Ukraine, pieces will be exchanged on the chess board.  Without a credible military response, the United States may well be forced to contend with irreparable harm to its credibility --- both in terms of nuclear negotiations and its interests in Europe and Asia.  It's one thing to oppose so called regime change wars or other misguided military adventurism, like George W. Bush's war in Iraq.  But it's another matter entirely to live with the consequences of America's withdrawal from global leadership.  It is on that precipice we stand now.

Angela Merkel herself has been backing Macron already in 2018.  Speech by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to the European Parliament, Strasbourg, 13 November 2018^([3][4]):  >I have proposed that we establish a European Security Council with rotating member state membership, in which important decisions could be more swiftly prepared. We need to create a fully capable, European military force for rapid deployment to affected regions in times of crisis. We have made great progress on permanent structured cooperation in the military domain. That is a good thing, and these efforts have received wide support here. > >Yet – and I say this very deliberately in view of the developments in recent years – we ought to work on the vision of one day establishing a proper European army. Yes, that’s how things stand. Four years ago, Jean-Claude Juncker said: a joint EU army would show the world that there would never again be a war between EU countries. That would not be an army in competition with NATO – don’t misunderstand me – but it could be an effective complement to NATO. Nobody wants to call traditional alliances into question. But, ladies and gentlemen, it would then be much easier to cooperate with us. When, as is the case at the moment, we have more than 160 defence or weapons systems and the United States has only 50 or 60, when each country needs its own administration, support and training for everything, we are not an efficient partner. If we want to use our financial resources efficiently and are pursuing many of the same objectives, nothing speaks against us being collectively represented in NATO with a European army. I don’t see any contradiction there at all. > >That would then also involve ... (heckling from the floor) – I welcome that response. That doesn’t bother me. I’m used to parliament. – > >That, incidentally, would also involve the joint development of weapons systems within Europe. And it would also involve – this is a difficult task, also for the Federal Republic of Germany – developing a joint arms export policy, because otherwise we would not be able to present a united front in the world.  Merkel at the signing of the France-German friendship treaty, January 2019^([5]):  > Chancellor Angela Merkel has said that a new Franco-German friendship treaty was a step toward the creation of a future joint European army. > >Ms Merkel said the pact aims to build a Franco-German common military culture and contributes to the creation of a European army. > > President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Merkel signed the deal, which pledges deeper economic and defence ties as well as commitment to the EU, in the German city of Aachen.  Another part of Merkel’s speech at the signing of the Treaty of Aachen^([23]):  > We are committed to developing a common military culture, a common defence industry and a common approach to arms exports. In so doing, we intend to help to create a European army. This will only work, however, if this goes hand in hand with efforts to coordinate our foreign policy. Those who are aware of the many things that happen each day also know what it means when we commit together now to assuming foreign policy responsibility and to standing up for our interests. However, this will only work if we improve the way in which we coordinate our development policy. Our neighbouring continent of Africa is a particularly important part of this.   German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer stated that a “coalition of the willing” could be the way forward^([20]):  >German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said the lesson from Afghanistan was that Europe must be able to act more independently to be a credible actor. > >But she insisted it is very important that we don't act as an alternative to NATO and the Americans. > >She appeared to push back against the idea of a standing force, saying on Twitter that coalitions of the willing among member states could come together to tackle future crises.   ## **Italy:**    In the past Italy has proposed concepts for a European force that did go beyond Franco-German proposals for defence integration^[6]. Although it is necessary to stress that they have also emphasized at other times that their proposals have not been aiming at a European Army (as well in 2016)^([7]):  > But Pinotti, the Italian defense minister, stressed that Rome’s proposal stopped short of calling for an EU army. > >“Nobody has actually talked about an EU army,” Pinotti said. “If we aim at this it is the wrong objective.”  Mario Draghi has expressed urgency regarding the need to strengthen European sovereignty and specifically European defense, but his words didn’t feel like a very concrete endorsement^([8]):  >For the Italian premier it is quite evident that the events of recent months are leading to a profound re-examination of the international dimension and the result can only be the strengthening of European sovereignty, one of the aspects being the strengthening of European defense. It began in a fairly explicit reflection on the organizational aspects that will keep us busy for the years to come, but to tell the truth there is not much time to wait for stability to be maintained .  Silvio Berlusconi has stressed the need to build a common European defense several times during his career (also during his time as Prime Minister).   His most recent remark are from the 5th of September.^([11]):   >Europe is powerless in the face of a tragedy like that in Afghanistan. The dream is that of the United States of the EU defended by a common army.    It is of course questionable how much influence he still holds within Italian politics and Forza Italia and whether his comments can be seen as representative of current trends. I would appreciate input regarding this.  Besides this also Italian general Claudio Graziano, incumbent president of the Military Committee of the European Union, expressed support and urgency^([9]):  >Geostrategic changes show that we need a stronger Europe. The situations in Afghanistan, Libya, the Middle East and the Sahel show that it is time to act, starting with the creation of a “rapid deployment force capable of show the will of the European Union to act as a global strategic partner. When if not now? Later it would be late,  He has been Chief of Staff of the Italian Army and Chief of Defence Staff of the Italian Armed Forces.   Giorgio Mulè, the Italian defense undersecretary, seems to share his opinion^([44]):  >The EU army is “a thing that must happen” said Giorgio Mulè, the Italian defense undersecretary. For him, “a group of nations” composed of the EU’s founding countries — Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg — should take the first steps.   The President of the Italian Republic, Sergio Mattarella, spoke about the need to create a European army the 5th of September^([10][55]) **read in the comments**.    ## **Spain:**  Pedro Sanchez, the current Prime Minister of Spain, joined the call of Macron and Merkel for a European Army in a speech before the European Parliament in January 2019^([12]):  > Honourable members in order to ensure the security of our citizens and strengthen our role as a true global power we need to act decisively determinedly in Europe on security defence slightly more than a year ago. We set up permits and in cooperation we're taking the first steps towards ensuring we have our own defence capacity. After decades of paralysis and the time has now come to be decisive in pursuit of this we need to move ahead openly towards the creation of a true European army the union honourable members must show the world that it has chosen to be a soft power if I can put it that way. It's a delicate choice. It's it's not a reflection of weakness. > We need the capacity to project Europe beyond our borders and the political willpower to do so. Those are vital recognition vital preconditions. If we are to be a critical global player European Union is an attractive model for many parts of the world. It's our union which allows us to aspire to playing a role of global leadership. We represent the possibilities of multilateral order that's based on the law and accepted common rules Spain is prepared to play its role in assuming that leadership thanks to our privileged relationship with Latin America North Africa and the Middle East. Nonetheless given major global challenges before us Europe has far less clout than it has in other areas where the union holds an exclusive competence. And with that in mind I like to share some thoughts with you. We need to become a true global actor which we're not today. That's what we need to do away with the rule of unanimity not just in external policy but also taxation.  Spain’s top military official, Chief of Staff Teodoro López Calderón^([21]):  >Spain’s top military official, Chief of Staff Teodoro López Calderón, told El Mundo newspaper in an interview published Wednesday that the EU’s dependence on the U.S. has been “absolute” and that the bloc must develop a military force to be a relevant player on the international scene. > >“If not, it will never be one,” he said. “Creating a European army means having a common foreign policy and that we all share the same interests. This is a political leap that still must be achieved. But I don’t think there is any doubt that Brussels should increase its military capacity. That is one of the important consequences of what happened in Afghanistan.”  ## **The Netherlands**:  The Dutch Minister of Denfense Ank Bijleveld has said in 2018 that her government opposes the establishment of a European army and that Merkel’s and Macron’s vision is going “far too far”^([13]).  She was forced to step down because of criticism regarding the evacuation of Afghanistan 10 days ago^([14]).  The incumbent Minister of Defence Henk Kamp is in office since 21.09.21.  In November of 2018 the stated position of Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, also has been in clear opposition^([28]):  > Prime Minister Mark Rutte does not feel like a European army (translator, please ). Europe cannot defend itself. That can only happen with American help, he warned. > >Rutte called the recent proposal by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron unwise. “The idea goes way too far. France and Germany are really ahead of the pack with that, he said.   It seems that the Afghanistan debacle has lead to a change.   After a meeting of Macron and Dutch Premier Minister Mark Rutte a joint declaration on the 31.08.21 read^([15]):   >France and the Netherlands acknowledge the need for a resilient and capable Europe to take more responsibility for its own security and defence, and to allocate the necessary resources to do so. To that end, they are committed to working towards an ambitious and actionable Strategic Compass that will enhance and guide the implementation of the level of ambition on security and defence for the years to come. France and the Netherlands are committed to preserving and enhancing their close cooperation on regions of shared strategic interest such as in the Sahel, the Levant, the Gulf or the Indo-pacific. France and the Netherlands reaffirm their strong support to the European Intervention Initiative (EI2) as an efficient framework to enhance common European strategic culture. > >In light of the deteriorating global security and geopolitical environment, France and the Netherlands recognize that NATO is the cornerstone of the collective defence policy of both countries and, in the context of the revision of its Strategic Concept, underline that strong and effective EU-NATO cooperation is more essential than ever. France and the Netherlands recognise that both the EU and NATO can support and complement each other when it comes to the expertise and instruments at our disposal. To that end, France and the Netherlands aim to adopt an ambitious Joint Declaration on EU-NATO Cooperation in December 2021.  After a meeting of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Mark Rutte read^([16]):  >11.Common Security and Defence Policy. From a security and defence perspective, European strategic autonomy means that the EU will enhance its global strategic role and its capacity to act autonomously when and where necessary and together with partners wherever possible. The Strategic Compass will help the EU and its Member States to take the necessary steps in order to gradually work towards fulfilling that ambition. This includes, amongst others, closer cooperation on crisis management (including missions and operations and the gradual reinforcement of command and control structures), resilience, capability development and partnerships. Further development of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and of other European defence instruments and policies will be crucial to achieving these objectives. >The EU needs to achieve the necessary capabilities, while taking into account the prior obligations undertaken by Member States, notably those corresponding to the signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty. It must be understood that a Europe that shoulders its responsibilities in the area of defence is a Europe whose actions will strengthen NATO and its objectives. These capabilities comprise, amongst others, the development of the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base; the human, technological and, above all, financial resources required to support it; and the establishment of a clearly defined and transparent framework for relations with third parties.     ## **Poland:**  I was very surprised to be able to include Poland on the “in favor” side of this list. As I started collecting material I was expecting to find and mostly also found content expressing worries of Poland about the often mentioned duplication of efforts and weakening of NATO through the creation of a European army.  On the 11.09.21 during a visit of Angela Merkel in Warsaw, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki gave an interview for the German newspaper FAZ^([17]):  >Poland and the European Union must be able to protect their borders. Current events are an attempt to attack these borders, sow confusion and destabilize Poland and the EU. > >I am working closely with the Lithuanian and Latvian governments; we must and want to secure the Union's eastern border even with increased migratory pressure. The situation is all the more tense because the Russian-Belarusian maneuvers Zapad 2021 have just started on the other side of the border. > >In my opinion, if the EU wants to survive, and if it wants to be strong, it must be a Union of sovereign states, a Europe of Nations, respecting each other's traditions and cultures. But at the same time it should cooperate very closely economically and **have a real European army**, which would be able to defend Europe from the south, east and north.  This must represent a major shift in the position of Poland. His mentioning of Lithuania and Latvia could also imply, that this shift has also occurred there. They, as other Eastern European nations, have been some of the strongest opponents of common European military capabilities.  ## **Portugal:**  In the past Portugal went as far as enacting a resolution against a European army^([18]).  The Portuguese Prime Minister at the time^([19]):  >All the conditions will be explained in the resolution of the Council of Ministers that will be adopted tomorrow, namely what we have already said thirty times and will be laid out in black and white in the resolution: we do not support a European army, we do not support the principle, nor do we support it being seen as an alternative to NATO, said Costa.  This position seems to have changed^[43]:  > “We cannot remain adolescents forever,” said Portuguese Defense Minister João Gomes Cravinho in a recent POLITICO interview. “We have to, at a certain point, stand up and say we assume responsibilities. That time has come.”  ## **Slovenia:**  Slovenia's defence minister Matej Tonin^([20]):   >Slovenia's defence minister Matej Tonin, also speaking on behalf of the rotating EU presidency, aligned with Borrell. > >This debacle in Afghanistan, also showed that, unfortunately, the EU doesn't have the necessary capability for operations in extreme circumstances, Tonin said. > >He then mentioned European battlegroups, small forces of some 1,500 troops. But their deployment requires consensus among all 27 member states, he said. > >Maybe the solution is that we invent a mechanism where the classical majority will be enough and those who are willing will be able to go, he had said, earlier in the day. > >Asked who would command such troops, he said the institutions of the European Union.  Prime Minister Janez Janša at the 16th Bled Strategic Forum (01.09.21-02.09.21), titled “the Future of Europe”^([21]):  >When asked by the moderator about migrations and the European Union's soft and hard power, he said that the EU's soft power was not enough and that hard power was also necessary. He highlighted that EU aid to poor countries often fails to reach those who need it most because a safe environment is not guaranteed. In his opinion, soft power is also not enough to ensure a safe environment, particularly after what has happened in Afghanistan. We see that the United States will no longer get involved with the actions of failing countries around the world, he said. He said that hard power and how to bring hard power into European politics is one of the most important issues in the debate on the future of Europe. In his words, the crisis area at this moment is not only Afghanistan, drawing attention in particular to the Sahel region in Africa. This is our immediate neighbourhood with 400 million people, a third of whom are ready to leave these countries, he said.To be effective in terms of soft power, the EU also needs hard power, otherwise we are just spending money and arguing with each other. He also stressed that the European countries did not want to repeat the mistake that was made in 2015 regarding the expected wave of migration. Not a single EU member state wants to repeat the experience of 2015 or the open borders policy, as happened in 2015 after the Syrian crisis.   ## **Hungary:**  Hungary’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó^([22]):  >“Hungary supports the affirmation of European defence cooperation”, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó declared at a press conference in Brussels to mark a meeting of EU Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers. > >“The Hungarian Government supports the preparations for the plan on the establishment of a joint European army and the goal of making Europe capable of operating and performing peace-making and peacekeeping missions in neighbouring regions”, Mr. Szijjártó explained. Viktor Orban called already in 2016 for the creation of a European army^([24]).  ## **Sweden:**  Sweden has historically been opposed.  But it has also been part of EI2 and has hosted the annual ministerial meeting of the initiative on the 24.09.21 in Stockholm^([39]), where the 13 defence ministers also “shared important lessons so far identified after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, including views on the implications for European coordination and capability requirements, and for transatlantic cooperation.”^([40]).  “At the margins of the meeting, a bilateral agreement on defence cooperation between Sweden and Portugal was signed.”^([41])   The statement also mentioned concrete objectives^([38]):  >Aim >We intend to enhance the bilateral dialogue on defence matters, with the aim to increase the understanding and co-operation between us, the Armed Forces and defence agencies and to identify further opportunities for cooperation on defence in the EU and in other multilateral arrangements including in NATO.  Among the objectives “European Defence Co-operation (including EU Common Security and Defence Policy);”^([38]).   This could also be understood as mostly of bilateral nature; the announcement regarding further development of the defence cooperation between France and Sweden on the same day (24.09.21) was much clearer in its language^([42]):   >As global commons, such as space, cyber, sea and air domains, become more and more contested, European countries must jointly defend their interests and values, and international law. This is our duty if we are to maintain security, freedom of access and navigation. We must act together because no one will do so on our behalf. > >European countries, together with our transatlantic partners, must meet these challenges together. In the aftermath of the events in Afghanistan we need to have an open and frank political dialogue on the lessons learned on international engagements and global commitments. Our credibility is linked to a strong political will and military capacity to act, combined with our ability to coordinate with our allies and partners. In this context, we cannot afford to leave the scene to terrorist organisations or to state actors who contest the international rules-based order. The security of Europe is first and foremost the responsibility of Europeans themselves. Europe’s security should strengthen European strategic autonomy in a way that directly benefits transatlantic and global security.  Interestingly also a specific model seems to be favored^([42]):  >As close partners committed to trust, transparency and cooperation, France and Sweden are coordinating their upcoming presidencies of the Council of the EU in the areas of crisis management, resilience, capability development and partnerships. We firmly believe that the EU and NATO are complementary partners in a transatlantic security web that includes other forms of bilateral, multilateral, and regional cooperation that vary in purpose and geographic scope. We are prepared to consider how regional groups of Member States could assume regional responsibility and act on behalf of the EU in a more flexible and reactive manner, building on the model of the Takuba Task Force.  At the same time this joint statement also provides one of the best insights into the agenda and direction the EI2 meeting in Stockholm took^([42]):  >Today, we will meet with Defence Ministers from the European Intervention Initiative, EI2, in Stockholm. We will discuss how like-minded European partners can achieve more together and ways to improve cooperation and common efforts. EI2 is an effective incubator and catalyst  for concrete efforts, gathering the political and military communities of our countries. In this regard, France and Sweden are firmly committed to promoting international law and upholding the European security, with Europe assuming its responsibilities as a security provider and through a strong, balanced and mutually beneficial transatlantic relationship. > >Florence Parly >Minister for Defence, France   > >Peter Hultqvist                 >Minister for Defence, Sweden   **Edit: Change of position due to new information**  ## **Greece:**  Greece just recently (28.09.21) bought three new french frigates. Both Macron and Greek Prime Minister Mitosotakis stressed a focus on European defence in this context^([43]):  >PARIS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Europe needs to stop being naive when it comes to defending its interests and build its own military capacity, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday after Greece sealed a deal for French frigates worth about 3 billion euros ($3.51 billion). >The Europeans must stop being naive. When we are under pressure from powers, which at times harden (their stance) , we need to react and show that we have the power and capacity to defend ourselves. Not escalating things, but protecting ourselves, Macron told a news conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. >This isn't an alternative to the United States alliance. It's not a substitution, but to take responsibility of the European pillar within NATO and draw the conclusions that we are asked to take care of our own protection. >Under Tuesday's agreement Athens agreed to buy three frigates with an option to buy a fourth for about 3 billion euros, a Greek government source told Reuters. >The accord, part of a broader strategic military and defence cooperation pact, comes after Athens had already ordered some 24 Dassault-made Rafale fighter jets this year, making it the first European Union country to buy the fighter jet. > >This will tie us for decades, Mitsotakis said. This opens the door to the Europe of tomorrow that is strong and autonomous, capable of defending its interests.  ## **General**   11 EU states (and Norway and the UK) are currently part of EI2, the initiative for a joint European military intervention force outside of the European Union and NATO, which might be an indication that it is possible that they would be in favor (although only a weak one, as the needed concessions differ vastly).   **EU Participants of EI2**:   Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Italy  **Then there is of course the list of the 14 European countries, that have proposed the rapid military response force in the first place^([45]):**   Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.  This list might provide the best glimpse of the current state of clear support for the endeavor, although it doesn’t really help to grasp what countries are strongly opposed or still on the fence. I am sure that if any other countries would have been in strong support of the motion, they would have been included (although the recent language of many state representatives seems to suggest that many have changed there stance recently).  A European Army is also part of the official program of the EPP^([46]), the largest party in the Commission as well as in the EUCO. The group has also expressed support publicly^([47]).  Manfred Weber, the leader of the EPP, said on the 12.09.21^([48]):  >The national armies, of course, remain the main pillars of defense. But, step by step, we need to build European capacities, such as a European reaction force with a few thousand men. And we also need a cyber-defense brigade,  The Council itself seems to agree with the general approach and the direction the Commission is advancing^([49]):  > The EU wants to **strengthen the global competitiveness and innovation capacity** of the Union's **defence technological and industrial base**. On 19 November 2018, the Council adopted its position (partial general approach) on the **European Defence Fund** proposed by the European Commission in the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2021-2027. > >On 13 June 2018, the European Commission presented its proposal for a regulation of the European Defence Fund as part of the upcoming MFF with a proposed envelope of €13 billion. The European Defence Fund aims to **foster innovation** and **allow economies of scale in defence research** and in the **industrial development phase** by supporting collaborative projects. > >In its partial general approach, the Council broadly agrees with the Commission proposal. In particular, it confirms the overall objectives and structure of the Fund, including the intention to **invest in disruptive technologies**. It mostly seeks to clarify a number of aspects in regards to the **eligibility of entities**, and **ownership of the results**. It also seeks to clarify the award procedures and criteria and the provisions concerning the share of the indirect costs that will be covered by the Fund, the latter being an important element **to make the Fund more attractive for industry players**. The Council further stresses that **special attention will be paid to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and mid-caps** in the Union. > >The approach adopted today is labelled as partial as the financial and other horizontal aspects of the fund will depend on the overall agreement on the next multiannual financial framework.  (Emphasis not mine)  # **Opposition**  ## **Czech Republic:**  Prime Minister Sobotka has called for the creation of an EU Army in 2016^([50]), but current Prime Minister Andrej Babiš has expressed his strong opposition in 2019^([51]):  > Recently, there have also been calls for the creation of a European army that might replace NATO in the future. I strongly disagree with that. I really do not want a European Commissioner to direct Europe’s defence and to address security threats in a similarly chaotic and improvising manner, such as saving the euro area. NATO is a proven and functional organization that can plan, do logistics, and has established management channels. None of this must be questioned. Within the EU, we can only better coordinate  arms purchases, but it will not be easy, because every country will want to protect its defence companies.  > > “I don’t think it’s time after Afghanistan to start opening discussions on the future of the European army,” said Jan Havránek, the Czech Republic’s deputy minister of defense. “I mean these are buzzwords.”  In general the Czech  Republic seems on a EU skeptic course recently.  An interesting fact is though, that the Czech Republic has signed the push for the “initial entry force”^([45]).   ## **Latvia:**  Prime Minister Laimdota Straujuma in 2015^([52]):   >There is a possibility it could be discussed in July at the European Council, but it's important to check whether this might be duplicating NATO, Straujuma told Latvian public broadcaster LTV.  Minister for Defence and Deputy Prime Minister of Latvia Artis Pabriks^([53]):  >Latvian minister Artis Pabriks said the bloc needed to show it had the political will to use any force if the plan was to lead anywhere. > >He noted that the battlegroups programme has been around for over a decade as part of the EU's common defence policy, but asked, Have we ever used it?   At the same time there seem also to be ongoing efforts to develop a common foreign policy with the EU and France. Rihards Kols (National Alliance), chairman of the Saeima Foreign Affairs Committee said during a meeting with representatives of the French Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs (22.09.2021)^([36]):   >The EU cannot afford a nearsighted policy. An effective strategy is needed to prevent that. This requires higher efficiency and also a principled common foreign policy that would ensure continuity and reduce the bloc's dependence on various election cycles, the Saeima press service quoted Kols as saying.  >  >Although our priorities, just like our geographical location and related geopolitical risks, may be somewhat different, we see that our French colleagues have an understanding and in-depth knowledge of the challenges we are facing here in the Baltic states. Close cooperation based on a clear strategy will help strengthen these ties also in the future, Kols said following the meeting.    ## **Austria:**  Historically Austria has been against a common European defence due to their policy of neutrality and not wanting to hand over command to the EU. In November 2016 former Federal Chancellor Christian Kern of the SPÖ^([26]) and the then acting Minister of Defense^[26] at the time held almost identical views as the incumbent Federal Chancellor Sebastian Kurz^([26]):  > While acknowledging the disruptive force the US election result is likely to have on the EU and the need to forge something of a European revival, the theme of security and defence policy has been more or less absent in their discussions so far. > >Austria has remained neutral for the last 61 years and joining the then-European Economic Community was not possible in the 1980s because of its stance on the Cold War. > >As relations with Moscow thawed and the USSR collapsed, accession talks began in earnest. The issue of neutrality never emerged as an issue during the negotiations and it has remained an almost sacred aspect of Austrian foreign policy, as demonstrated by opinion polls. > >In practice, of course, Austria still participated in political and humanitarian efforts in the Balkans and other missions as part of the NATO Partnership for Peace, of which it is a member. But when it comes to the EU and defence, this is an entirely different matter. > Austrian political reaction has been expectedly negative. The country’s Chancellor, Christian Kern, has indicated that he cannot imagine the Austrian army being under the control of a non-Austrian high command. For Austrian Defence Minister Hans Peter Doskozil, the idea of an EU army is incompatible with the country’s neutrality and he has therefore outright rejected it. > >As much as Austria’s two main parties, the SPÖ and ÖVP, would like to have different opinions on the issue, there actually appears to be a consensus between the coalition partners. Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz has confirmed that he is against any measure that goes against Austria’s neutral stance, so a common European army has not even been discussed. > >Even for the chalk-and-cheese presidential candidates, Alexander van der Bellen and Norbert Hofer, opposing an EU army is a uniting factor. > >There are, of course, voices that are not so fierce in their opposition to the idea. Vice-Chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner said that an EU army could be an option that would prove necessary, which is a view that is shared by the country’s European Commissioner, Johannes Hahn, and the ÖVP’s European Parliament fraction chief, Otmar Karas.  In June 2020 Kurz reaffirmed his opinion^([27]):  > Kurz said Austria was in favour of “close cooperation among EU countries” but not a European army, while stressing the need to “ensure stability on the (EU’s) southern and eastern borders.”  An interesting fact is though, that Austria has signed the push for the “initial entry force”^([45]).     ## **Malta:**  Prime Minister Robert Abela, 16.09.21^([30]):  >Questioned about the EU commission president’s emphasis on the need to introduce an EU-wide military force during a state of the union speech, Abela said Malta would stick to its neutrality obligations as enshrined in the constitution.   ## **Denmark:**  On September 22nd, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, said “she did not believe a new security pact between Australia, Britain and the United States that excluded France and cost Paris a defence project was grounds for a transatlantic dispute.”, breaking ranks with Germany, other European member states and EU institutions^([31]):  >I think it is important to say, in relation to the discussions that are taking place right now in Europe, that I experience Biden as being very loyal to the transatlantic alliance, Frederiksen told Danish daily Politiken from New York, where she was attending the United Nations General Assembly. > >And I think in general that one should refrain from lifting some specific challenges, which will always exist between allies, up to a level where they are not supposed to be. I really, really want to warn against this, she added.  “Asked whether she can understand the French criticism, Frederiksen replied: “No, I cannot. I do not understand that at all.”^([31][32])    She also stated that she would go up against those who try to undermine transatlantic cooperation^([33][54]):  >Asked about Mr Macron's plans for the EU to operate more independently on defence issues, Ms Frederiksen told Politiken, a Danish broadsheet: I would also like to say quite clearly that I will at all times go up against those who try to undermine transatlantic cooperation - whether it happens in Europe or at home in Denmark. > >“The most important, stand-alone explanation for the fact that Danes, Europeans and Americans have been able to live in safety and security for decades is the transatlantic cooperation that grew out of the ashes of the world wars.  > >It is, by volume, the strongest alliance for democracy and freedom and fundamental human rights, and it must not be undermined by thoughts of a stronger Europe at the expense of strong transatlantic cooperation.”  Many British newspapers have horribly editorialized the title and the context of her words. Yes, she expressed opposition, but no Denmark did not “vow to resist Emmanuel Macron's EU army plans”.     She stated:  > I think it is important to say - in relation to the discussions that are taking place right now in Europe - that I experience Biden as very loyal to the transatlantic alliance. And I think, on the whole, that one should refrain from lifting some concrete challenges, which will always be between allies, up to something that it should not be. I really, really want to warn against that, says Mette Frederiksen to Politiken.     ## **Estonia:**  “To date, Estonia is the only country on NATO’s eastern flank to join the French-led European Intervention Initiative.”^([34])  Having said that, they seem to have been historically opposed to the idea just as other Baltic leaders^([37]).  ## **Lithuania:**  Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda expressed on the 01.04.20 his worry about a duplication of NATO capabilities^([35]): >Talks of a separate EU defence system are raising special concern and would lead to confusion as it would duplicate NATO, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said on March 10 while addressing participants of the Bucharest Nine meeting of foreign ministers in Vilnius. In the middle of 2018, nine EU member states, including the United Kingdom which left the EU in January, backed France's proposed initiative to establish a European defence group.   As other Baltic nations, they have been critical of common Euroepan capabilities in the past^([37]), but it remains to be seen, whether the erosion of trust and confidence in the United States due to the Afghanistan debacle  in combination with increased insecurity because of the recent Russian Zapad-21 military exercise close to the borders have changed minds in Riga, Tallin, and Vilnus.     ---  # **Sources**:  You will be able to find all the sources in the comments.

evanFFTF	Comcast is trying to censor our pro-net neutrality website that calls for an investigation into fake FCC comments potentially funded by the cable lobby	114350	6cvg82	https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6cvg82/comcast_is_trying_to_censor_our_pronet_neutrality/	2491	2017-05-23 15:43:21	technology	Fight for the Future has received [a cease and desist order](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ) from Comcast’s lawyers, claiming that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) - a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign possibly funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast’s valuable intellectual property. The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control.  The notice is ironic, in that it’s a perfect example of why we need Title II based net neutrality protections that ban ISPs from blocking or throttling content.   **If the FCC’s current proposal is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply censoring this site -- or other sites critical of their corporate policies -- without even bothering with lawyers.**  The legal notice can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ). It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case [Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer) which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)  [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections.

We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.  Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just behave when they have abused their power time and time again.

Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access.   Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!  Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.  This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.  The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas.   So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**  **EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a site blocked message to show they could be censored, or an upgrade your Internet service to access this site fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**  **EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this.
evanFFTF	The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. This could be the last chance for Internet users to make their voices heard.	76630	7779es	https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7779es/the_fcc_is_expected_to_announce_a_vote_to_gut_net/	3211	2017-10-18 15:23:12	technology	Hey reddit, I wanted to give everyone a heads up that Ajit Pai, former Verizon lawyer and current chairman of the FCC, is expected to circulate the text of his rule and announce a vote to gut net neutrality protections on November 22, the day before Thanksgiving.  **[That means these next few weeks could be our last chance to speak out to defend net neutrality. You can use this tool to call your lawmakers.](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**  Once the FCC announces a vote (which would likely be at its open meeting in December), it will become much, much harder to stop them from gutting the rules that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T from charging us all extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling, blocking, and censoring websites, apps, games, and streaming services.   The good news is that we are hearing from people who are meeting with Congress that there are key lawmakers who are sympathetic to the cause, and considering stepping in to slow down the FCC. **But they need to be getting a lot more phone calls from constituents in order to act.**  The groups behind the big Net Neutrality [day of action](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) that happened back on July 12 are calling on all Internet users, websites, apps, subreddits, and online communities to do everything they can to drive as many phone calls to Congress as possible between now and November 22.   **There's an easy click-to-call tool set up at https://www.battleforthenet.com**  **We have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join**  Our best shot at saving net neutrality is if we can get phones ringing off the hook in Washington, DC right NOW. It's a long shot, but it's our best shot. Please spread the word, and message me if you want to learn more or get involved.
cam_man_can	Let's get Trump to accept climate change	22228	5byi0k	https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/	928	2016-11-09 04:45:05	environment	Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change?   Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this.   Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen.   I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.  1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans.   2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.  So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input.   I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.  Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.  Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.  Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a business pitch of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry.   Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.

nate	Raising the taxes of graduate students by as much as 300% will be a disaster for the USA	124379	7e1jo1	https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/7e1jo1/raising_the_taxes_of_graduate_students_by_as_much/	10922	2017-11-19 16:24:07	science	Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.     Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.   This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA.    This is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).  In comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).   What can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.

It was harder to read how the young ones have no idea, and that we lost a generation of leaders, gods...its still so very sad. What I remember most is that we had to divert our own communities resources in the middle of an attack by the Oregon's Citizen's Alliance, because no one helped us, so lesbians became hospice workers, and we funded our own research, and still we lost nearly every single one that got sick, no matter what we did. I remember my boss getting sick, and the county trying to pull his medical insurance out even as he was dying. Or my friend D****, who had lost his partner and everyone else he'd ever loved, so that when his time came to get sick he just gave up and died, only three months before the protease inhibitors came out that would have saved him. And we nearly lost the attempts the OCA made to criminalize us, in the middle of this brutal epidemic. I'm still so angry. I try to remember more how we gained unlikely allies, and how eventually the world came around to see us as human beings, but I'll never forget that they left us to die on our own.

CrowGrandFather	My thoughts on a decade of Cyber Security: 10 Lessons I’ve learned	1860	p9fo4d	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/p9fo4d/my_thoughts_on_a_decade_of_cyber_security_10/	116	2021-08-22 16:32:32	cybersecurity	I’ve spent a little more than a decade working in cyber starting with fixing computers at my local pizza joint all the way to leading a security operations center (SOC) for a multibillion-dollar enterprise with thousands of users and hundreds of thousands of machines. Here’s ten lessons I’ve learned along the way.  &#x200B;  ## 1. Cyber is risk and nothing else  It’s important to understand that businesses think in terms of money and risk. If the potential money gain outweighs the risk of money loss, then that idea is likely to go forward; however, the opposite is also true. If something is more likely to lose money, then that idea is likely to get stopped. Cyber security falls squarely in the latter category.  Businesses are constantly looking at what is costing them money and what’s bringing in money. Cyber security is a money pit. Money gets poured into cyber security, but it does not make any profit. Some companies have gotten better about understanding how reliant their business is on cyber, especially in the COVID era where online shopping is the safest way to shop but understanding reliance on cyber does not translate to understanding reliance on security.  A CFO once asked why we spend so much money on antivirus when the company hasn’t had a virus outbreak in 5 years. This question struck me because the answer seemed so obvious; we haven’t had a virus outbreak because we have antivirus. But to the CFO who’s only looking at dollar this seemed pointless. Why spend hundreds of thousands a year to put AV on every desktop when we haven’t had a virus in years. He was thinking reactive, and I was thinking proactive.  This shift in mentality is where I see a lot of room for improvement in traditional SOCs. We need to learn to speak like a finance officer. We need to be able to explain to them how proper cyber security enables their money-making activities.  Going back to my antivirus example I learned that I needed to speak the language of finance, I needed to speak in terms of money.  ## 2. No one cares about your stats  This is a direct continuation of the previous point but it’s important enough to list on its own. No one cares about your stats.  Businesses love stats and metrics. They hire teams of statisticians to make crunch numbers all day and figure out how to squeeze an extra 1% efficiency out of every sector because that extra 1% means more money. The truth is though, no one cares about your stats because your stats don’t mean anything.  When I worked as a SOC analyst monitoring firewall logs and IDS alerts I had to report metrics at the end of every shift. We reported things like how many firewall blocks happened, what our top IDS alerts where, how many, if there were any true positives, and several other menial points of data. Out of all that data there was only really one that mattered, and it only mattered to the CISO; were there any true positive IDS alerts.  The metrics we were reporting didn’t matter because they didn’t speak the universal language of business. A statistician can’t take firewall hits and translate that into saved money. We were never reporting AV blocks because it just wasn’t in our SOPs to report it. So, a CFO never saw that the AV he spent $500K a year on was blocking thirteen threats a month. Even if he did $500K for thirteen threats sounds like a lot of money for not a high return.  We must translate stats to money. When I was asked about the AV, I didn’t have a satisfactory answer because I never stopped to think like a CFO. I spent the next month trying to figure out how much an incident cost the company. I spoke with the HR department to figure out what the average pay of an Incident Responder was so I could calculate overtime pay, I spoke to finance to see how much money it cost in server downtime, I spoke to devops to figure out how long it would take to restore a server, and I spoke to the incident response team to figure out how long it took them to respond. After I crunched all the numbers, I figured out that it cost around $50K per incident.  Armed with this knowledge I looked at how many AV hits we had each month and found that that AV was saving the company about $650K **each month**. The CFO was shocked when he heard that number; spending $500K a year saved them almost $7.8M yearly. And that is the point about stats. No one cares how many events your firewall blocks, but they do care about how much money that saves. Learn to translate those stats into money. Don’t report just failures, report how the security apparatus is working and how much money it’s saving the company on average.  ## 3. Understand that not everyone is as smart as you  It should be obvious to everyone working in this profession but cyber is broad. Some people are expert malware analysts but can’t make heads from tails of a packet capture (PCAP) and consequently some people can rip a C2 beacon out of a PCAP but can’t find PowerShell usage in Window’s event logs. The point is that cyber is broad and no one is an expert in all things.  I’m not giving you carte blanche approval to be a jerk but understand that just because you’re a master with Wireshark doesn’t mean everyone else is. What may seem obvious to you may not be obvious to someone else. Understand that your peers may not have the same knowledge, experience, or analytical reasoning that you do; and by extension you don’t have the same that they do.  You may need to take time to explain your thought process to others. It’s not an insult of your intelligence when someone asks you to explain your reasoning. It’s far more likely that this is something new to them. At the same time, it’s not incompetence to ask others to explain their reasoning because you don’t understand. I’ve had to explain my thought process on multiple occasions when I open an incident, and in almost every one of those occasions it was simply because someone else didn’t see the same indicators in the traffic that I did. After a quick explanation we agreed on opening an incident.  People are human, they miss things. We all miss things. Don’t be an a\*\* when someone asks you to explain your reasoning.  ## 4. Stop with the playbooks  Playbooks are good, but too many playbooks are a hinderance. It’s important to have some playbooks for standard things; what do you do if ransomware happens? What happens if you get malware on the network? What do you do if there’s a breach of a critical service?  I mention this because I have worked in multiple places that tried to either create too many playbooks or wanted extremely specific playbooks. One office I worked in wanted a playbook for every variant of ransomware. How do we respond to Locky Ransomware? What about for NotPetya? WannaCry?  We also had playbooks for botnets, malware, cryptominers, etc. Every new family of malware needed a new playbook. We spent so much time making playbooks every time we had an infection that we probably missed more than we found. None of these playbooks were properly indexed of course, so whenever we had an investigation, we had to hunt through shared drives and folders until we found the appropriate playbook so we could follow the “approved” process for dealing with it. Was Dridex in the botnet folder or the banking folder under malware? Wait it’s in both? Which one is more updated?  On the opposite side of the house, I’ve had some bosses who wanted playbooks so specific that we hardly had anything usable. This playbook can only be used when the Dridex malware infects exactly three computers all on the same VLAN and communicating with a C2 server in China. Playbooks like this were worthless because they were never used since the criteria were almost never met.  Playbooks are good, but they need to be at the appropriate level.  ## 5. Read the news for your boss  Don’t read the news to your boss, read it for your boss. I can’t even begin to count the number of times I’ve had my boss ask me about some ridiculous thing they read about on CNN or Wired.  When the Pulse Secure VPN exploit made major news with a CVSS score of 10 I got the distinct pleasure of answer a barrage of questions about what we’re doing about this. My answer was simple; nothing. We’re doing nothing because we don’t have Pulse Secure VPNs on our network.  We should never be caught off guard by things that show up in the popular news outlets. You can be forgiven for not knowing about something that appeared on an obscure Twitter post, but if something gains enough steam to be reported on by a major mainstream news outlet then you should know about it before your boss.  Telling your boss that you don’t know about something that hit mainstream news hurts your credibility as a professional, but more than that it can lead to extra work for you and your team. I’ve been involved in incident response operations that kicked off because someone’s boss read an article on CNN and wanted answers. When his SOC team lead couldn’t speak on the matter the CISO tasked the incident response team to investigate.  We could have, and did, tell the CISO and the SOC that we weren’t vulnerable to what they read about but the gears were already in motion, and everyone was wound up, so we went out to respond to a threat that didn’t exist in the first place.  ## 6. Blackhat is mostly pointless  I’m going to make a lot of people mad here, but I passionately believe that conferences like Blackhat cause more issues than they solve for those of us in the cyber trenches. Blackhat, Defcon, RSA Con, Threat Intelligence Summit, etc. are good for introducing the world at large to up and coming threats to unique components but for the vast majority of SOCs it doesn’t matter.  I’ve said for a long time that the things you were concerned about before Blackhat are probably the things you should still be concerned about after Blackhat. If you’re a traditional IT network most of what gets talked about probably won’t apply to you. Even if it does apply to you, it’s important to understand the level at which it applies to you.  Look at the concept of Google’s Row hammer exploit. When it was introduced, it made major news because of the potential it had on Cloud Virtual Private Server (VPS) providers. A threat actor could exploit a vulnerable virtual machine (VM) to manipulate the memory of the physical server to extract data from a different VM on the same physical VPS. This concept made major headlines but when tested by Microsoft it was determined that it was exceptionally difficult and generated sub optimal row activation sequences.  Even though this was technically feasible and potentially devastating it was something not worth worrying about unless you’re dealing with data of National Security. A Blackhat conference may disclose a way to exfil data out of a VM at 1Kbps but is that something you should worry about? At that speeds an attacker might get a single word document in about a week.  What you were concerned about before Blackhat is what you should still be concerned about after Blackhat.  ## 7. Location, Location, Location  One of the most challenge concepts new SOC analysts seem to deal with isn’t investigating new malware strains; its understanding the location of our sensors and what they can provide.  In your enterprise right now, there are a lot of logs, if your System Information and Event Management (SIEM) is set up correctly you probably won’t see all the diverse ways logs come to you, but you probably have several. IDS logs, Firewall logs, DNS logs, proxy logs, IPS alerts (if separate from IDS), Window’s event logs, Domain Controller logs, Linux server logs, antivirus logs, and more. Not every source of logs shows the same type or amount of data.  In my anecdotal experience one of the most difficult things for SOC analysts to learn is where to look for distinct types of information. SIEMs help correlate all these logs to give analysts an easier way to move between them, but a good analyst still understands what sensor collects what and how to move between sensors in an investigation.  Let’s say that you see a connection to a known bad IP address. Depending on the location of the sensor you might have more or less information. You might need to query other sensors for what you want.  When I first started working in a SOC we didn’t have full log ingesting in our SIEM. The SIEM got firewall logs, but we also had an IDS outside the firewall and different subnets had their own edge routers (yes it was a double NAT) with their own IDS behind the router. Depending on where you looked you might not see the actual host IP address as everything would be behind a NAT.  I’ve also been asked to consult on the location of new sensors to help fill in some gaps we had. Before I could answer that I needed to know where we already had sensors and what they could see.  ## 8. You’re probably doing threat intelligence wrong  This one is going to be a hot take, but you’re probably doing Cyber Threat Intelligence Wrong. Looking up IP addresses in VirusTotal is not threat intelligence. Same with domains and file hashes. Your SIEM should be automatically enriching your data with this type of information. Reading reports and checking twitter for IOCs to plug into your SIEM because your CFO doesn’t want to pay for Crowstrike’s premium addon also isn’t Threat Intelligence. True threat intelligence is a nebulous concept, but I’ll try to provide my take on it.  My first job working in a SOC was in the threat intelligence section. My job was to read reporting grab IOCs (mainly IPs, domains, and Hashes) then search them in the SIEM to see if we had and connections. The job was frankly a waste of time. Using a feed to enrich our Splunk data quickly made my job obsolete as everything I was doing became automated.  During my time doing threat intelligence I asked our incident response team how often they used threat intelligence in their operations. The response was a resounding **never**. In fact, one of the responders even went as far as to say that Intelligence actively hurt one of their ops.  I spent some time thinking about what type of intelligence they would need. Your intelligence team needs to understand what the critical business assets are, what the vulnerabilities are around those critical assets, what capabilities exist against those vulnerabilities, and what sensors are in place to detect them. Threat intelligence should read about how attackers conduct campaigns, map that to the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, and then overlay the content they can detect. Using all of this we can create predictive intelligence to help incident response find previously unknown compromises.  ## 9. Don’t write to be understood, write so that you can’t possibly be misunderstood.  Report writing is something we’re all going to have to do at some point. Far too frequently we write assuming the people reading our reports has the same level of knowledge that we do, except that’s not always true.  My team wrote reports that went all the way up to the CEO. And we rewrote the report when the CEO had no idea what we were talking about. Years ago, when I was a just a threat analyst I wrote a report about indications of a worm on the network, only I never mentioned a worm. I forget what the report actually said but I remember getting into a heated discussion with my boss the wording.  She read the report and told me flatly that she didn’t see any threat. I was aghast because I thought it was plainly obvious where the threat was, but she didn’t get it. I explained that this was indications of a worm and she told me now she understood but if this reached the C-Suite folks they wouldn’t get it. I was an arrogant young analyst and replied that it wasn’t meant for them, so it didn’t matter if they understood it.  Much like my third point in this post I didn’t consider the fact that others who want to know might not be able to understand what I’m saying. I wrote my report to be understood by a very small subset of people.  Writing to not be misunderstood also means writing clearly using established terms, frameworks, and a common lexicon. How many times have you heard people refer to the Eternal Blue vulnerability? Eternal Blue was an exploit, the vulnerability was CVE MS17-010. It’s important when we’re writing to be specific and accurate because you never know who will be reading it.  ## 10. Make friends with your Marketing team  When I first started my career in Cyber Security, I held the, unfortunately normal, believe that art degrees didn’t belong in Cyber Security. Don’t pollute my science with your art; boy was I wrong.  Art absolutely has a place in the realm of cyber security and marketing can be a major ally for you when you’re trying to convince leadership of something.  One day I was trying to explain to my boss how a malware campaign was propagating through our network and why we needed to take certain actions to stop it. She didn’t understand what I was trying to convey. We gave her our 23-page report on the malware which included lots of granular detail and screenshots of hex code, PCAP, C code, and log files. To this day I’m convinced she never read it because it was far too long. She wouldn’t advocate for our suggestions because she didn’t understand what we were suggesting.  I was trying to figure out how I could get my message across, I consider my public speak skills to be above average so if I couldn’t convince her with a presentation then I needed something else. My team was brainstorming and eventually someone said, “what about an image?”. We all agreed that an image was worth a shot but none of us were graphic designers, so we were ready to write that idea off or try to make something with PowerPoint when I had the idea of asking an actual graphic designer.  I went over to marketing and explained the situation to their team lead. He listened for a while and then took me over to see their graphics design team. I met with the graphics design folks and explained the situation again when an absolute gem of a human said she would. What followed was three days of back-and-forth communication as she would desperately try to understand what we were saying and translate that into an image. At the end of the three days, she had created a single image masterpiece that clearly illustrated the points we were trying to get across to leadership.  Art and marketing absolutely have a place in cyber security. When you think about it from a business perspective, I was trying to market my positions to my boss, and who is better at marketing a position then the team who is made specifically to market products?  If you look at major threat intelligence companies like Talos or the Microsoft Security Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) you might notice that most of their reports also have some clear graphics to go with them. A well-designed image can convey the same information as a 23-page report.  ## Conclusion  My time in cyber security has been a wild journey and I’ve learned a lot. I hope these ten lessons will also be useful to you on your journey through this career.

You will not receive any training whatsoever and we fully expect you to know our entire network and infrastructure inside and out, as well as all of our tools and internal processes, before your first day. You'll spend most of your time performing extremely complex tasks without any input or assistance from the more senior members of the team, who view your very presence as a waste of their time.   If you do not provide an immediate ROI on our decision to hire you, you will be fired, then hogtied and thrown into the trunk of a 1987 Toyota Tercel, which will then be pushed off a cliff. The cost of the vehicle will be taken out of your paycheck and the remaining balance will be transferred to your loved ones, who will be informed of your passing by HR.  Requirements:  - MSc in CompSci or Cybersecurity (PhD. preferred) - A+, Network+, Sec+ are all mandatory (CISSP preferred) - minimum three years of IT experience (Sr sysadim experience preferred) - must be willing to work non-stop, including nights and weekends, to constantly learn more skills to provide more value to the company, all without any expectation of additional compensation for yourself  - experience speaking at conferences and industry events (BlackHat, RSAC, etc) - you must personally know at least one member of my current team members and that person must vouche for you and swear upon their mothers grave that you will give me opportunities to ask my superiors for more money - you must be willing to self-flagellate and beg to keep your role throughout your entire tenure, while verbally acknowledging to the senior members of your team that you are nothing, you are replaceable, you are lucky to have any job at all  Salary:  $15 / hr   No benefits to start but we will reevaluate after one year   ** TWO WEEKS LATER **   UGGGGHHHH there's such a skills shortage in cyber, I can't find ANY good candidates!! These millennials and zoomers are so entitled, don't they know that you need to work hard to find white collar jobs??   I mean, back in my day, a semester of college was the same price as a pair of jeans and multiple companies would offer you a job with a salary that could easily support a family of 4, including buying a home, paying for two cars, and putting 2 kids through college, but I know all about hard work!!1! Who do these young whippersnappers think they are?!  ********  EDIT:  Glad to see that most people got the joke but to those that didnt: it's called satire. Lighten up a little.  Also, I'm happy to report that I'm fully employed and I like my job. I work for a cyber vendor so not really a technical guy (tho I do have a Sec+ thank you very much) but I feel for all the people trying to break into cyber.  It's just a little contradictory for companies to complain about a skills shortage while having unreasonable expectations for entry level roles and also not being willing to train people or help new folks get into the cyber industry.   Like, if it's a problem for your organization, then take a look at how you're contributing to it and try to implement solutions. If it's not a problem, then stop bitching about a skills shortage and start paying for the talent you need.

resnica	Dolly Parton's The Buddy Program	248	k3u2sy	https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/k3u2sy/dolly_partons_the_buddy_program/	11	2020-11-30 11:25:48	education	In 1990, the high school dropout rate for Dolly Parton's hometown of Sevierville Tennessee was at 34% (Research shows that most kids make up their minds in fifth/sixth grade not to graduate). That year, all fifth and sixth graders from Sevierville were invited by Parton to attend an assembly at Dollywood. They were asked to pick a buddy, and if both students completed high school, Dolly Parton would personally hand them each a $500 check on their graduation day. As a result, the dropout rate for those classes fell to 6%, and has generally retained that average to this day.   Shortly after the success of The Buddy Program, Parton learned in dealing with teachers from the school district that problems in education often begin during first grade when kids are at different developmental levels. That year The Dollywood Foundation paid the salaries for additional teachers assistants in every first grade class for the next 2 years, under the agreement that if the program worked, the school system would effectively adopt and fund the program after the trial period.   During the same period, Parton founded the Imagination Library in 1995: The idea being that children from her rural hometown and low-income families often start school at a disadvantage and as a result, will be unfairly compared to their peers for the rest of their lives, effectively encouraging them not to pursue higher education. The objective of the Imagination library was that every child in Sevier County would receive one book, every month, mailed and addressed to the child, from the day they were born until the day they started kindergarten, 100% free of charge. What began as a hometown initiative now serves children in all 50 states, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, mailing thousands of free books to children around the world monthly.    On March 1, 2018 Parton donated her 100 millionth book at the Library of Congress: a copy of Coat of Many Colors dedicated to her father, who never learned to read or write.
MantaRay2256	Do not go into teaching until society gets its act together - Too dangerous, both physically and mentally	244	11fdk1o	https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/11fdk1o/do_not_go_into_teaching_until_society_gets_its/	56	2023-03-01 19:17:11	education	Teachers wonder why so many of our kids are so awful.  It's because they are being raised by awful people.    Our society makes it as hard as possible to properly raise children.  Both parents must work fulltime to provide the kind of life we see in all the ads: kids with smartphones, high speed internet, two new vehicles, a bedroom for every child, vacation cruises, toys galore, spotless homes, new furniture, steaks for dinner, tons of tools, etc. - and it's been that way for the last 50 years, approximately two generations.  Neither parent has the time or energy to teach and enforce boundaries.    What we have now are kids being raised by kids who were improperly raised.  No boundaries.  No framework.  No scaffolding.  Just hand them a smartphone and let them learn from their apps.    Society will reap what it sows.  Meanwhile, teachers are left to teach other people's children society's boundaries, while at the same time being excoriated for teaching children boundaries.  Too many parents resent whenever a teacher imposes boundaries, probably because they know that it's supposed to be their domain - so they lash out. They can't do it, but by God, they won't let anyone else.  Teachers are in trouble with administrators and parents for poor classroom management, but when teachers try to impose any consequences for poor behavior, they are thwarted.  Kids sent to the principal come back ten minutes later with a treat.  Do not go into teaching until society gets its act together.  Kids and their parents know no boundaries.  It's too dangerous - both physically and mentally.

MouniaDeMa	Bachelor student who would really appreciate your help to narrow down my research question on the EU climate-security nexus in the Sahel region.	1	11svavy	https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalDevelopment/comments/11svavy/bachelor_student_who_would_really_appreciate_your/	0	2023-03-16 14:12:18	globaldevelopment	 R**esearch question: How does the EU climate-security nexus seek to address climate-related issues in the Sahel?**  Thank you for reading this in advance1 (Apologies I am not a native English speaker).  I am a last year student and I am incredibly interested in climate change and how it functions as a threat multiplier in the Sahel, which is already fragile for climate-related risks.  For months, I have troubles starting my research (which is already approved) and have difficulties narrowing down the scope of the research. Especially since a new mandatory criteria requires me to select a local NGO from the Sahel that could benefit from my research.  So I believe the next step is to find a specific EU climate-security nexus approach which can be linked to a (specific) climate-related issue in the Sahel? But I fail to do so, after reading so many documents and even made a table of different EU strategies, projects etc, but find it complex. Truth be told; the process becomes a bit overwhelming and I start to become really insecure about my ability to succeed.  My supervisor is unfortunately not helpful at all…in the last meeting he said that he did not read my research proposal and forgot about the subject. He said that I could start all over again or email an professors and see if they might help. I don’t want to give up….  My research proposal is approved, but I encounter so many issues with narrowing down the scope of my research I would really appreciate some guidance😊. I want to graduate and do this. . I would be forever grateful.  Down I elaborated a bit on the research:  Sub-questions:  1. How did climate change develop as a security issue on the EU agenda? 2. What are the main EU responses to tackle climate related security risks in the Sahel region? 3. To what extent is the current EU climate-security nexus approach in the Sahel effective? 4. What role could the EU play in future climate responses in the Sahel?  From what I understood, the EU’s policies related to the climate security in the Sahel can be categorized as follows:  A) Development policy, Climate policies , Security policies, Peacebuilding and conflict prevention, and diplomacy  So overall, the EU climate-security nexus acknowledges the complex relationship between climate change and security risks in the Sahel and addresses these risks through a comprehensive approach that includes development, conflict prevention, humanitarian assistance and military support.  Moreover the EU-climate-security nexus considers climate-related issues in the Sahel as followed:  B) Drought and desertification, water scarcity, land degradation, migration, conflict.  I compiled a list of interesting EU projects and policies, which I can eventually send too.
Notarealmonica	I am keen to hear your thoughts on a targeted regional assessment for funding diabetes intervention initiatives in Papua New Guinea	1	q1it90	https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalDevelopment/comments/q1it90/i_am_keen_to_hear_your_thoughts_on_a_targeted/	0	2021-10-05 00:03:22	globaldevelopment	These are some thoughts I put together recently for an aid project development course, and I am keen to see what people think about it:  The projected reduction of Australia’s contribution to health development spending in Papua New Guinea is contrary to the six pillars of the agreed bilateral, regional and global objectives documented in the Australian Prime Minister’s comprehensive strategic and economic partnership statement published in August 2020. The Australian government’s support through DFAT to PNG population is through a commitment to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The Australian Prime Ministers’ goal is clear which includes ‘strengthening cooperation between our health institutions, especially on financing, planning, infrastructure, information sharing, and systems’ best evidenced by the implementation of COVID 19 surveillance and infectious disease management strategies. A revisited DFAT and PNG Health Ministry approach will combat the burden of diabetes mellitus using available evidence-based interventions. Implement a program that improves the currently underdeveloped diabetes care amongst the population, promoting individual socio-economic potential, community health infrastructure development and regional security partnership growth.  Background: Prevalence of diabetes mellitus type I and II are documented in the World Health organisation 2005 report as a global burden of disease particularly in middle-income countries; estimating that 7.1 million people will die due to complications from elevated blood sugar levels. Diabetes is a systemic and non-communicable disease that may lead to severe eye disease including blindness, neuropathy requiring wound care and surgical treatment, kidney damage and cardiovascular risk factors. Since the year 2000, the incidence of diabetes in Papua New Guinea has increased, with a higher representation in type II requiring access to specialist health care support rather than lifestyle and nutrition factors, further documented in the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study. Chronic kidney disease is also associated with obesity, poor endocrine and cardiovascular health, loss of socio-economic potential and early mortality.   Local hospital data supplied by the PNG Government shows the progression of regional diabetes prevalence since 1980, further defined in a 2008 report which showed 10 per cent of the pilot study population had elevated blood sugar levels (BSL) despite being asymptomatic. The WHO prevalence study conducted over twelve months in 2008-2009, which documented over 14% of adults between 15-64 years of age had a fasting BSL of over 6.1mmol/L, classified as clinically serious. From 2012 to date, a Papua New Guinean Department of Health document stated that there had been no regional or national implementation of standards in the surveillance, diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus, ensuring safe, appropriate and timely management of those affected.  The 2020 Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade development cooperation sheet cites the relationship with PNG with Australia as its’s largest development partner, stating three main objectives aligned with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The first is promoting effective governance (SDG 16 and 17), enabling economic growth (SGD8), and the enhancement of human development (SDG 3 and 4) in addition to promoting gender equality. In addition to government cross-level of USD300 million toward economic reform, the DFAT budget for PNG development programs and defined performance indicators was reduced by Australia from AUD607.5 million in 2019, AUD596 million in 2020, with a projected spend of AUD491.1 million, 2% of which on health development in FY2021. The reduction in spending on a clear regional disease burden by the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) overview of the aid programs to Papua New Guinea citing health security as it’s foremost pillar before regional stability and economic recovery following in the remaining five pillars. FY19-20 Key performance indicators list polio vaccination, road development and internet infrastructure as fundamental contributors to economic growth, with general governance as a principal investment.   The listed strategic objectives in the 2020 DFAT published PNG program progress report includes the enhancement of human development, citing health services and health security systems as critical outcomes. However, the projected family planning initiative and tuberculosis reduction targets fall short of expected impacts. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is unlisted in the last four annual program progress papers, and the resultant disease burden in PNG remains unaddressed. At present, the Papua New Guinean leading public health risk factor for attributable disease leading to disability is high fasting blood glucose, beyond smoking and obesity. On a global scale, PNG ranks ninth for years lived with disability resultant of diabetes against comparator countries as Moldova, Pakistan and Yemen.  Support:   The published guidelines by Diabetes Australia list the four key activities in combatting the community and regional prevalence of diabetes mellitus:   • Leadership for diabetes – national advocacy, policy, campaigns and communication to raise awareness of diabetes and its impact.   • Living with diabetes – supporting self-care and choice, promoting the best possible management of diabetes to help prevent complications, and supporting all ages and stages of diabetes. These activities cover type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes and other diabetes.   • Preventing diabetes – promoting and developing prevention policies and programs for risk assessment, early detection and prevention, both in high-risk populations (two million Australians are at high risk of developing diabetes) and at a whole-of-population level. • Research for diabetes – supporting, funding and promoting the best diabetes research.  An Australian government-supported, PNG based program will lead to defining and diagnosing the onset of diabetes mellitus, using a community/person-centred care approach, particularly in the presence of associated lifestyle risk factors. Specifically, the implementation of the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) 2009 evidence-based guidelines define the screening and risk category fields for establishing regional support requirements within community groups. The collation of community health surveys contributes to identifying people at risk and engaging treatment protocols aligned with lifestyle counselling and reducing contributing factors such as obesity, malnourishment and smoking. The implantation of these guidelines will be enhanced by a novel telemedicine program that mentors local clinicians providing care with remote support from Australia.  Community-based education such as the Diabetes Prevention Program and mitigation of individual lifestyle factors can occur with low resource requirements. However, ongoing clinical monitoring, diagnosis and treatment for DM types I and II should occur within a health facility to discuss abnormal results and safe clinical interventions delivery. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2019 health promotion report does not recommend diagnosis and treatments outside of clinic facilities.  Unfunded Requirements:   • The principal costings components of diagnosed diabetes are apportioned by the American Diabetes Association as follows: hospital inpatient Care 30%, prescription medication to treat complications of DM 30%, anti-diabetic agents and medication delivery supplies 15%, with physician office visits and clinic time as the remainder. The broader developmental targets for PNG are impacted further by indirect outcomes of disease burden, including reduced productivity and absenteeism, inability to work due to related disability, and lost productive capacity of the population due to early mortality.  The following requirements form the unfunded portion of the interventions required to decrease DM prevalence in PNG:   Programs for the prevention of progression from type I to type II diabetes,   Reduction of the chronic kidney, cardiovascular, neuropathy and microvascular complications   secondary to diabetes,    Diagnostic and pharmaceutical support for endocrinologist led treatment regimes, and   Reduction in infant / maternal mortality and morbidity associated with gestational diabetes  A course of action proposal  COA 1 Targeted infrastructure support including diagnostic and pharmaceutical support to enable the four critical activities defined in Diabetes Australia published guidelines, with the implementation of the NHMRC 2009 evidence-based guidelines for treatment, supported by the community-based Diabetes Prevention Program, measured in a 2022 prevalence study to determine impacts (in YLL and DALY) of the program against 2030 SDG3 projection.  COA 2 Development of telemedicine consultation for community outreach clinics, using local infrastructure to deliver diagnostic and consultant support. Aid program to provide consumable and pharmaceutical support to PNG health clinics for distribution under community projects.  COA3 No action  Conclusion: DFAT should investigate the apportionment of infrastructure development funding toward the Australian comprehensive strategic and economic partnership pillar of health security during FY 21-22. Specifically, funding toward diminishing the prevalence of the leading risk factor for disease burden as defined by diabetes mellitus, in keeping with evidence-based best practice guidelines as documented in the attached links.

The majority of my offences did not require extensive technical knowledge and were committed through easily identifiable web application vulnerabilities.  I was apprehended because I was an idiot. At the time, I didn't care or even consider the possibility of the consequences of what I was doing. Despite using Tor, I did not adequately obfuscate transactions and reused Bitcoin addresses when making ransom demands. As a result, many of my offences were linked, providing the authorities with a larger surface to work with.  I spent two years in a prison cell for 23 hours per day and my honest opinion is that freedom is far more significant than anything that you will obtain from criminality. If you're not willing to commit to a lifestyle of criminality, then don't do it.  I believe that I am reformed because this experience has truly changed my perspective on life in general. While I was on bail, I engaged extensively in vulnerability disclosure using the responsible disclosure model and I have since reported vulnerabilities (P1 - P3) to the Crown Court Digital Case System (CCDCS), the National Crime Agency (NCA), the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Parliament, the University of Cambridge, Deutsche Bank, the Australian National University, Stanford University, ESET, Yahoo, Royal Airforce (MOD), GCHQ, TD Bank, DBS Bank, AT&T, Esri, the BBC, Sony, Deutsche Telekom, the United Nations, Duke University, Adobe, AOL, Telegram, Sage, Amazon, Virgin Media, Houzz, NOAA, BT, University of Wales, BMW, Lamborghini, Financial Times, Europa, Jaguar, Harvey Nichols, Hugo Boss, Admiral, MIT University, Europa, HSBC, Chanel, Bank of Melbourne, the Royal Bank of Canada, Huawei, the Ministry of Defence, Swedbank, NHS, Telegraph, VICE, NASA, MSI, Costco, Gucci, ESPN, GumTree, Asos, Harvard University, Booking, CBC, Sandisk, Yahoo, Rambler, Acer, OVH, UK Fast, Independent, Telstra, University of Oxford, HP, Barclays, Litecoin, Aerohive Networks, and hundreds more over a 4 year period.  Please keep in mind that I will not respond to questions about criminal activity. Please don't think I'm ignoring you, I'm not here to promote or advocate criminality. The purpose of this post is to inform others about my experience and share insight so that they can make their own decisions.

I’m Dr. Robert Blumofe ([u/RobertBlumofe](https://www.reddit.com/u/robertblumofe)) Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at Akamai ([u/akamai\_technologies](https://www.reddit.com/user/akamai_technologies)), former UT Professor, and MIT and Brown University graduate. But most people call me Bobby. This is my first AMA and I’d be happy to take you behind the curtain of what we do at Akamai, how I started my career, how a kid growing up in a show- biz family became a nerd, or even my hobbies (I’m a juggler, water-skier, former pilot, and novice musician).  [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/VNFkmFh)  If you’re not familiar, Akamai powers and protects life online. Global companies trust us to deliver and secure digital experiences — helping billions to live, work, and play online. With the world’s largest and most trusted edge platform, Akamai keeps apps, code, and experiences closer to users — and threats farther away.  I’ve been at Akamai since 1999 and previously I’ve been responsible for developing and operating the distributed system underlying all Akamai products and services. Today, I lead Akamai’s technology strategy and represent Akamai’s technology vision in the marketplace.  Ask me about Zero Trust, why I hate that moniker, why I think that all access should be remote access, and why I think there is no such thing as a secure network. And on a personal level, how to do a three-ball cascade, my favorite drummers, growing up in Beverly Hills, or anything about my grandfather, comedian Jack Benny!  &#x200B;  \#########  EDIT \[1 p.m. ET\] Thank you for the great discussion and questions today, r/cybersecurity!

InternalCode	Confessions of a cyber security hiring manager	1132	rc31oa	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/rc31oa/confessions_of_a_cyber_security_hiring_manager/	522	2021-12-08 22:44:46	cybersecurity	EDIT: There seems to be a huge disconnect between hiring managers and potential candidates. This post is meant to shed light on why you might not be getting jobs. If you're a hiring manager and have a different experience, throw it in the comments, shed some light on it. If you're a candidate and salty that this is how it works in most places, air your grievances below...   I've hired approximately 25 people into various cyber security roles recently. Primarily, entry level SOC Analysts, Penetration Testers and Risk Analysts.   Every entry level (and senior) role I advertise, gets maybe 75 - 100 applicants.   30% of these applicants have 0 cyber experience, 0 certifications and a cover letter that says basically cyber security pays well, give me a job.   30% of these applicants have a degree in cyber security and/or Security+ and one or two other certs. But no IT experience and no cyber security experience. They are usually grads / young.   30% of these applicants have a security+ certificate and 10+ years of experience in management/accounting/lawyering/Consulting. But now want to make a change into cyber security. They know how to handle tough stakeholders, project manage, communicate, etc.   5% of these applicants are the ones you have to sift through. They have 3 or 4 years experience as a IT helpdesk/sysadmin/netadmin or developer. They have 100s of hours on Hack the box. They have spoken at a local security conference on a basic topic, but one they know inside out. They have a degree and/or Security+ and/or Azure/AWS cloud experience. They are really passionate about cyber security and you can see they spend all their spare time doing it. Some of my team will know them (cyber security is a small industry) and red flag them as they're hard to work with or they made racist comments at a bar during a conference. Some will be flagged as seems nice or helped me once with a CTF.   Then you've got the final 5% of the applicants, they have the same as the above BUT they went to uni with one of my existing team, or my existing team know them through CTFs/conferences/discord, etc. My team vouches for them and says they're hard working.   I know people will respond and say but i don't have time to do 100s of hours of hack the box. I get that. I'm not saying you have to. I'm saying this is what you're competing against.   As a hiring manager, I'll always hire guys who are passionate about cyber security. It'd be a disservice to me and my team to not hire the best and make us cover for them.   I know some will say you can't just hire people's friends. Sadly this is how most of the industry works. It's because cyber security people are used to dealing with and reducing risk. Hiring someone my team has worked with (over months) and likes is less risk than hiring someone after two or three hour long interviews. Good people know good people. So if you're team is good, hiring people they think are good is a win.   What's the outcomes of this post?   Well, if you're struggling to get a job with just a security+ or a degree, know what you're up against. I fully believe that you will find a job but you'll need to apply on 50 - 100, or even 100s. You'll need to find that role that doesn't get applied on by the person doing hours of hack the box and such in their spare time.   Additionally, if you're struggling to get a role. Make friends! Network! Go to industry events, jump on LinkedIn, etc. Be the person in uni who turns up to all the classes and meets people. Don't be the asshole who does no work in group projects.  I see quite a few people on here getting a Security+ and then claiming they can't find a job anywhere and there's no shortage. I've hired people with just Security+ or base level knowledge before. It's months before they get to be useful. During that time, theyre having to shadow a senior and take up that seniors already precious time. My seniors all already have a junior or three each that they are training. This industry is starved for seniors. I see the difference between a junior and a senior as, can you operate mostly independently? For example, if i give you a case that an exec has opened a malicious .html file attached to an email, can you run with it? Can you deobfuscate the JS, discover IOCs and can you load those IOCs into some of my security tools? Are you good with Splunk, Palo Alto, Fortinet or Crowdstrike? Can you chat to the exec about this? Can you search all other mailboxes for more emails and delete them? Can you check sentinel for proxy logs and see who else may have clicked them? All of these skills are the shortage we are experiencing. I don't expect anyone to know all these. You'll still probably have to ping a colleague on if theyve discovered any great deobfuscation tools or the exact query to search O365 mailboxes. But I don't have seniors to give you an intro to Splunk, Palo, Sentinel, whatever. Therefore, if you can get some training and experience with tools and actually put them to use, you'll find yourself much closer to being a senior and standing out amongst candidates.   Ideas  Setup an instance of Splunk, setup a Windows VM and some security tools, onboard it's logs to Splunk, download some malware (Google GitHub malware samples), run this on your windows VM and write queries/alerts/etc to identify it. OR buy a cheap Fortinet firewall model, setup it up at home for you and family, setup rules, block all ad domains, set the IPS to alert on everything, tune the signatures, setup a VPN for when you're out and about OR do hack the box and learn practical offensive security knowledge.

erh_	The TLS Handshake -- everything that happens to get that coveted padlock 🔒	984	1126lt1	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1126lt1/the_tls_handshake_everything_that_happens_to_get/	86	2023-02-14 14:25:16	cybersecurity	# The TLS Handshake  In this write up, I want to talk through **everything that happens between YOU and the WEBSITE** you are visiting in order to get that coveted padlock. 🔒  To do this, I'm going to make references to this infographic:  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FnU7FKiaUAYNBCt?format=jpg&name=4096x4096  This image illustrates all the messages sent between the **Client** (your web browser) and the **Server** (the website you are visiting) to initiate a TLS session.  It might be helpful to have this image opened in another tab while you're going through the explanations below.   ^( *Image source is from a Twitter thread. Link is at the bottom of this post* )   ---  # Preface  As we go through this, keep in mind **the goal of SSL / TLS is to do two things**:  * ✅ Makes sure the Server is really who they say they are * ✅ Establish Session Keys to protect the ensuing data transfer   Before we get into the Handshake itself, we have to briefly mention two things:   ## Record != Packets  Each line in the image above represents a “*Record*” sent in the TLS handshake. This is not the same as a *Packet*.  Sometimes multiple Records fit inside a single Packet, and other times multiple Packets are required to carry a single Record.    ## Cryptography  To understand the TLS Handshake, you should be familiar with the following Cryptographic concepts:  * [**Hashing**](https://youtu.be/HHQ2QP_upGM) * [**MACs** and **HMACs**](https://youtu.be/doN3lzzNEIM) * [**Encryption**](https://youtu.be/o_g-M7UBqI8)  We won't be going into the depth of these concepts in the write up below. This will allow us to **focus on just the handshake** without getting into tangents about cryptography.  But if the terms above are unfamiliar to you, feel free to check out the videos linked above for more info.    With that out of the way, let's start unpacking all the records that make up the TLS Handshake:  ---   # 1️⃣ Client Hello  The TLS Handshake starts with the Client sending a **Client Hello**. (in this context, the Client is your web browser)  Inside the Client Hello are 5 important fields:  * SSL Version  * Random Number * Session ID * Cipher Suites * Extensions   Each of these fields contributes something to the overall goal of the TLS Handshake.   ## 1️⃣.1 -- SSL Version  The Client sends the highest version of SSL it supports. i.e.`SSL 3.0`, `TLS 1.0`, `TLS 1.1` `TLS 1.2`, and so on.    The Server does the same in the next record. The Client and Server then proceed with the highest mutually supported version of SSL/TLS.  Today, only `TLS 1.2` and `TLS 1.3` are considered secure, but note that this method of version negotiation is a little different when negotiating TLS 1.3.   ## 1️⃣.2 -- Random Number  Client generates and contributes 32 bytes of Random Data.   This will be “mixed in” to the final session keys which secure data between Client and Server.  This provides what Cryptography calls “entropy” -- additional randomness” for the ensuing Session Keys.   ## 1️⃣.3 -- Session ID  SSL/TLS has a feature known as “Session Resumption”, this allows the Client and Server to resume an older session, avoiding the hard work of asymmetric encryption and key derivation.  This field is what the client uses to request an abbreviated handshake.  Our handshake will proceed with a *full* handshake -- which is to say we are *not* doing Session Resumption in this illustration.    ## 1️⃣.4 -- Cipher Suites  A [**Cipher Suite**](https://youtu.be/P1v6QA0W7Xw)” specifies a particular algorithm for **Authentication**, **Key Exchange**, **Symmetric Encryption** & **Hashing**.    In this field, the Client sends a list of all Cipher Suites it supports.  The intent is for the Server to pick a supported Cipher Suite from this list.    ## 1️⃣.5 -- Extensions  Extensions provide additional features that did not exist in the original RFC.   This allows updates to how the world does SSL/TLS without requiring an entire re-write of the protocol.  To keep it simple, we will proceed as if no extensions were included.  Although many are required in modern TLS sessions.  ---  # 2️⃣ Server Hello  The Server then sends a Server Hello, which include these fields:  * SSL Version  * Random Number * Session ID * Cipher Suites * Extensions   Notice they match the fields in the Client Hello. The server is responding to what was offered by the client.    ## 2️⃣.1 -- SSL Version  Server offers the highest version of SSL it supports – now both the Client & Server know the highest mutually supported version.    More information on the differences from each versions of SSL/TLS here:    - https://youtu.be/_KgZNF8nQvE - https://youtu.be/fk0-UqwVNqY    ## 2️⃣.2 -- Random Number  Server also generates and shares 32 bytes of randomly generated data.    ## 2️⃣.3 -- Session ID  Server uses this field to either:    **(A)** Confirm the Client/Server are doing an abbreviated, resumed Session  or  **(B)** Assign a label to the current SSL/TLS session, for possible future Session Resumption   *(note: Session Resumption in general changes pretty significantly in TLS 1.3 )*  ## 2️⃣.4 -- Cipher Suites  Server selects a Cipher Suite from the list offered by the Client.   Fun fact: in TLS 1.2 and prior there are 300+ possible Cipher Suites, and only 20~ are considered secure by modern standards.  TLS 1.3, thankfully, reduces the list to just 5!   ## 2️⃣.5 -- Extensions  In this field, the Server is responding to the various extensions offered by the Client in the Client Hello.  The general format is the Client offers something in the Client Hello, and the Server responds in the Server Hello.  ---  # 3️⃣ Certificate  In this record, the Server sends it’s Certificate.  The Certificate acts as the Identity of the Server.  Specifically, it associates the **Server’s Asymmetric Key Pair** (Public & Private Key) with a **specific identity** (i.e., the website you are visiting)   **Inside the Certificate is the Server's *Public* Key**. The intent is that only the legitimate Server has the matching Private Key.  Shortly, the Server will send something that proves the Server has the matching Private Key.  This is how the Server's identity is validated -- **TLS demands proof of ownership of the matching private key**.    # 4️⃣ Server Key Exchange  The Server starts a [Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](https://youtu.be/KXq065YrpiU) by sharing a Public Value.  This will be combined with the *Client’s* public value to create a secret value known only to the Client and Server -- the ***shared secret***.   **Notice, the DH Public Value is Signed.**    This operation uses the Server’s Private Key, and is validated using the Server’s Public Key (from 3️⃣ Certificate).  ✅This proves that the Server is who they say they are, because (again) a Certificate links an identity to a specific Key Pair.   *Final Note about Key Exchanges:*    This handshake is illustrating a [**Diffie-Hellman**](https://youtu.be/KXq065YrpiU) Key Exchange, this is considered *more secure* than the alternative: **RSA**.  In an **[RSA Key Exchange](https://youtu.be/Pq8gNbvfaoM), only the Client contributes a value** and the  4️⃣ Server Key Exchange record will not exist.    # 5️⃣ Server Hello Done  This is an empty message indicate the Server is finished sending records.  There are other SSL/TLS handshake variations in which the Server sends more records. The Server Hello Done record sent here indicates this handshake is NOT one of those variants.    # 6️⃣ Client Key Exchange  In this record, the Client is sharing their half of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange by sharing their DH Public Value.    After receiving this record, both parties can perform the Diffie-Hellman calculation and create the Shared Secret.  ---  #  Interlude:  ## At this point **two** things are true:  - The **Server’s identity has been verified** thanks to the Signature from the Server Key Exchange.  - **Both Client & Server have** completed the DH Key Exchange and **calculated the Shared Secret**.  In theory, no one else knows the Shared Secret.  The Shared Secret acts as what TLS calls the **Pre-Master Secret**.  ## Time to Generate Session Keys...  This **Pre-Master Secret** is turned into the **Master Secret** by combining four values with something akin to a Hashing algorithm:  - Shared Secret (result of DH KX) - Client Random Number from 1️⃣ - Server Random Number from 2️⃣ - The literal string `master secret`  The result *is* the **Master Secret** -- and that **Master Secret** is then used to generate the actual **Session Keys** that will protect data.   Specifically,  **four Session Keys 🔑 will be generated**:  - *Two* Symmetric Encryption Keys - *Two* HMAC Keys  **These keys** are the ones that **actually secure and encrypt the ensuing Application Data**.  One set of Keys secure data *in each direction*:  * Client ---> Server * Client <--- Server  Yes, **TLS actually creates *two tunnels*,** one which secures data sent by the Client (and received by the Server), and the other which secures data sent by the Server (and received by the Client).  In all cases, these keys are *Symmetric*, which means *both* parties need *all four keys*.   The **Symmetric Encryption Keys** will be used to provide **Data Confidentiality** using a protocol like `AES` or `ChaCha20`  The **HMAC Keys** will be used to provide **Data Integrity** using hashing algorithms like `SHA256`, `SHA384`, and `Poly1305`.  (The HMAC keys also *indirectly* provide Authentication, since in theory only the other side of the connection could have completed Diffie-Hellman and created the aforementioned keys)  More info on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authentication: https://youtu.be/WfR3ZAP96mQ  ## All that is left to do at this point...  All that is left is for the **Client and Server to prove to each other they each have the correct Session Keys**.  They do this by sending the ensuing Change Cipher Spec record and Finished record.  Of these, the Finished record is the important one.  ---    # 7️⃣ Change Cipher Spec (Client)  This is an empty record which merely indicates that the next record is encrypted.  The Change Cipher Spec record is somewhat unnecessary, and no longer exists in TLS 1.3 (the latest version of SSL/TLS)    # 8️⃣ Finished (Client)  The Client calculates a “**Verification Value**”, then **encrypts it with the *Client's* Session Keys**, and then sends it to the Server.  The Verification Value is a hash of:   - Master Secret  - Literal string `client finished`  - Hash of all handshake records *seen* or *sent* (except Change Cipher Spec)   **The Server calculates the same Verification Value**, and decrypts what was sent by the client.

No-job-no-money	I finally got my first pentest job!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks /r/cybersecurity	970	ngqsin	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/ngqsin/i_finally_got_my_first_pentest_job_thanks/	116	2021-05-20 04:33:27	cybersecurity	My origin post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/lxurtt/21m\_fantastic\_bug\_bounty\_experience\_oscp\_cve/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/lxurtt/21m_fantastic_bug_bounty_experience_oscp_cve/)  Hey everyone, I finally landed my first pentest job by using my bug bounty experience(from a bank).  It starts on 6/1. I'm very excited and a bit nervous at the same time lol hope I don't mess up the application or accidently do something stupid(This position is kind of like red team basically being an attacker finding vulnerability from the application). This is also my first full-time job.  EDIT:  I have been pursuing a position within the Cybersec space for almost a year but then I completely change my shitty resume after I post my story here and I got like 7 interviews with around 30 jobs applied.  Thank you especially people who gave me advice about my resume and how to bypass HR from my origin post!

I made a post asking for some free resources so I can add them to this [cybersecurity page](https://hero.page/cybersecurity), and I got so many links, and went down so many rabbit holes, that I've built a pretty good resource for myself (and hopefully for others)! I also had a few other redditors helping me build these spaces too, and for that I am *extremely* grateful.  My goal was too make a no-fuss place where you can access free stuff.. no ads or sign up modals on every page, I hope you find it useful too!  Here are some of the dedicated spaces for which resources have been added (Lots of PDF's):  [Cyber Security Job Interview Toolkit](https://hero.page/cybersecurity/cyber-security-job-interview-toolkit)  [Byte Sized CyberSecurity TikToks](https://hero.page/cybersecurity/byte-sized-cybersecurity-tiktoks)  [Security Templates](https://hero.page/cybersecurity/security-templates)  [Cyber Security Search Engines](https://hero.page/cybersecurity/cyber-security-search-engines)  [Infosec Tools](https://hero.page/cybersecurity/infosec-tools)  [Exploits & Vulnerability Catalogs](https://hero.page/cybersecurity/exploits-vulnerability-catalogs)  [Digital Forensics and Incident Response](https://hero.page/cybersecurity/digital-forensics-and-incident-response)  [General IT Security](https://hero.page/cybersecurity/general-it-security)  [Cheatsheets](https://hero.page/cybersecurity/cheatsheets)  [Penetration Testing](https://hero.page/cybersecurity/penetration-testing)  [Knowledge Bases](https://hero.page/cybersecurity/knowledge-bases)  [44 Cybersecurity YouTube Channels to Learn IT](https://hero.page/cybersecurity/44-cybersecurity-youtube-channels-to-learn-it)  &#x200B;  I tried my best to only add free resources.

ulyssesric	Boss hired a new advisor, and his first demand is RESTful APIs should not response HTTP status code.	889	vxvn1o	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/vxvn1o/boss_hired_a_new_advisor_and_his_first_demand_is/	215	2022-07-13 05:39:40	cybersecurity	OK I've just had the most WTF moment in my career life yesterday. I don't know how to react to this so I'm posting here.  My boss hired a self-claimed software engineering expert, a stick-in-the-mud type old guy, to oversee our ongoing project, which is a set of HTTPS RESTful APIs for IoT devices, which use client side X.509 certificate for authentication and short-term JWT bearer token for further access control.  After a glance review our spec document, his first demands is ***your APIs should not return status codes***.  The conversation goes like:  **We:** Why ?  **Stick-in-the-mud:** *Because you should not reveal any information to hackers.*  **We:** What ?  **Stick-in-the-mud:** *These codes, 200, 401 and 403, I don't know what's these for but they must represent something meaningful. And hackers will know whether he is doing right or wrong. This is not good.*  **We**: But status code is the most important part in any RESTful interface. The APIs simply won't run without these codes.  **Stick-in-the-mud:** *Maybe you need it for legit users, but if hackers connected into your server, he can keep poking around and figure out what's going from these status codes.*  **We** (realized that he had no idea about how HTTP works): Listen, we have authentication scheme and access control. What a hacker can learn from 'forbidden' message ?  **Stick-in-the-mud:** *He can keep guessing password until you let him in.*  **We:** (speechless).  Then he left.  This happened just yesterday and he is ought to return and report his findings to boss next Monday.  The question is: how do I convince boss that he is an A-hole from last century that knows nothing about RESTful security practice of modern age ?  \[EDIT\]  **Problem solved.** After talking to boss about his demand, boss' first reaction is like ***WTF !?*** So  boss is more familiar with technology than we thought.  Turns out boss didn't hire the advisor to supervise us. He is just a relative of boss' former boss,   recently retired and now seeking a position as consultant in our office. Boss can't refuse this request but promised to keep that guy away from RD teams.

I have been a Systems Administrator for the past 5 years, so I have performed various security functions, as well as security auditing/compliance. However, I also did many other things as it wasn't solely an IT Security position.  EDIT: I have been pursuing a position within the Cybersec space for 2 years now, and was a candidate for this position for 7 months! Some delays with moving things along, but I stayed dedicated the entire time (I was also working during this time). I actually didn't get the original job that I applied to, but they offered me a different position that was just as great!  My title is Network Cyber Security Engineer for a mostly O365 environment, and my duties & responsibilities include:  * Install, operate and maintain security responsibilities, including firewalls, proxy systems, logging, and other security devices and appliances. * Provide security expertise and security infrastructure expertise to the company. * Facilitate new electronic data interchanges. * Assist in the enforcement and monitoring of Compliance regulations. * Defines security requirements, based on the overall security strategy and reviews and implements systems to comply with established security standards. * Develop new technology standards as necessary. * Analyze business needs, researches and recommends technology solutions to ensure the security of the infrastructure and overall network. * Establish and manage relations with vendors and related equipment suppliers.  I was wondering if anyone has any advice for going into the role, and what I can perhaps try to brush up on so that I can make the best first impression when I start.  Thank you! I've learned a lot being a part of this subreddit for the past few years and thank everyone for being so helpful.

Professional-Dork26	This sub is annoying....	847	v9mxzf	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/v9mxzf/this_sub_is_annoying/	241	2022-06-11 01:42:44	cybersecurity	When I posted something asking for help on what certs to get next after CySA+, the mods disapproved my post saying read the stickies.... Yet day after day, I see the mods of this sub let people with no experience or certifications post the same questions.  I've been getting very angry at a lot of the posts in the sub. Why? I want to come here to learn about cybersecurity and get help for security projects. But VERY few people here seem to actually do cybersecurity. I'm sick of seeing posts from people who have absolutely no experience and/or passion for technology looking for cybersecurity jobs because they pay well....  I've taken over security for my company and I am fucking **baffled** at the number of security professionals who overlook the most basic security measures. It is scary. So many people want to do cybersecurity without actually putting in the work, getting experience, or having genuine passion for technology/security. 100% support people trying to improve themselves and improve their living situation. But people who seemingly want to make a transition to cybersecurity solely for an easy paycheck are getting to me....  &#x200B;  My advice to any mods of this sub who may read this so I'm not just whining/ranting.... start requiring mod approval for posts and tell all these posters to please go take their questions to the itcareerquestions subreddit  &#x200B;  Edit: Oh goodness....Here come the down votes from the people I'm talking about (which seems to be about 80% of this entire community)
sma92878	Fundamental Skills for InfoSec from a hiring manager, who has reviewed 100 resumes and done 30 interviews with people from Reddit within the last month	846	v2ziwo	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/v2ziwo/fundamental_skills_for_infosec_from_a_hiring/	217	2022-06-02 03:22:22	cybersecurity	Hello all,  I've gone through about 100 resumes I've received from Reddit for people who are trying to get into InfoSec. I wanted to provide the community some feedback and how to improve your chances to break into the industry. These are not my personal views, but I know the industry well, and have many friends who are also hiring managers. These are points to help you maximize your chances of getting into the field.  &#x200B;  1: OPERATING SYSTEMS (You need to understand them at a moderate level of detail)  Many of the resumes and candidates I've looked at don't have a solid understanding of Linux AND (not or) Windows operating systems, specifically how Windows domains work. I would guess unless your a researcher focusing on IoT, 99.99% of the devices you will work with will run on Windows or Linux. Even if you're a pentation tester you're going to be going after Windows domains.  Setup a few servers on AWS, Azure, or GCP, whatever you like. Get a Windows server up and running, promote it to a Domain Controller, add a second Domain controller to the domain, add a member server, and a workstation. Understand how group policy, OUs, and other basic features of Windows environments work.  For Linux, I'll be honest, this is a shit situation because the Linux+ is a trash certification for folks in InfoSec.  No one cares if you know how to partition hard drives manually, but all that stuff and other non-essential items are on the certification. However, you can learn a lot, understanding how services work, adding your own custom services, managing configuration files on the file system, understanding where your logs are going, those are all critical things to know.  Spend time looking at the CIS hardening standards for operating systems and try implement them, you'll learn a LOT, and you can try and figure out how to circumvent those hardening standards.  &#x200B;  2: LEARN TO SCRIPT / CODE (Python or PowerShell)  The InfoSec industry is moving towards automation. Human's as wonderful as they are slow, compared to computers for repeatable tasks, they are error prone when reviewing large data sets. We just finished a major project for a hospital that was trying to have humans risk rank over 30 million vulnerabilities. They were going to spend millions of dollars on contractors, and we solved their problem in 6 months with Splunk, lots of Python, and industry standard CVSS environmental scoring algorithms. Like it or not, within 5 years, if you can't write code, you likely will not be in the industry at all.  &#x200B;  3: BE OPEN (InfoSec is a broad space)  I created a whole separate post on this that was well received (see below), but it blows me away that when people think of InfoSec they 95% of the time think of two jobs.  1. Penetration tester 2. SoC engineer  Holy crap people InfoSec is SO MUCH BIGGER than those two jobs. We do a lot of system deployment work for people.  We do a lot of work with Splunk and Secret Server, but there's SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY out there for folks with platform deployment skills. Also if you can get in with a company where you can keep learning how these platforms work, it sets you up long term for architecture positions.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/sxfivm/how\_to\_make\_money\_and\_get\_into\_cyber\_security/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/sxfivm/how_to_make_money_and_get_into_cyber_security/)  &#x200B;  4: HAVE A PASSION PROJECT (You will not succeed without passion)  I'm going to be honest, if you're just getting into InfoSec for the money, you prob wont make it.  There's so much to learn, and the industry changes to fast. I've been in the industry for over 20 years and I STILL MUST keep my skills up. Second, InfoSec from a purely clinical perspective is a shit job. No one will give you a hi five when you do your job right, people will only come down your street when something slips by.  I have a friend who's a CISO for a fortune 100 company, and we were hanging out a security conference down in NC. A young kid came up to him and asked:  How to I become a CISO  Brian responded: Paint a target on your back. If you don't have passion for this space, good luck.  People will say Oh but why should I have to work on side projects, x, y, or z profession doesn't have to. I don't care, neither do other hiring managers. Accounting likely hasn't changed in the last 100 years, InfoSec changes every 100 seconds, and it you're not keeping up on your own, you will be less valuable to me or any organization every week you're employed. I know many of you won't like that, but that's reality.  &#x200B;  5: KNOW SOME PRODUCT (I personally hate this)  I'm going to say I personally DESPISE how product focused our industry is, it seriously makes me sick, but it's the industry. If you want to increase your chances of getting a job dive deep into a product, Splunk, Palo Alto, CrowStrike, Duo, whatever. That allows a company to put you into a position and you can immediately contribute.  In my business we do a LOT of training, people prob get $10,000 worth of training before they are every put on a project with a customer. Sadly, most of the industry is not like this.  I'm talking to my peers about my Reddit recruitment and I think the idea is starting to catch on, but sadly most companies have pretty trash training budgets. If you can learn some product you've given yourself a solid leg up.  &#x200B;  6: THINK LONG TERM (Avoid dead end jobs)  I hear so many people talking about how they can get six figures right out of college.  This is VERY rare, you need to be in the top 5% of new applicants out there. People have a tendency to be short sited. If you have two job offers in front of you:  1. $70,000 salary zero training budget 2. $50,000 salary and $10,000 training budget  You better take option 2, first off you're going to pay taxed on the extra 20k, and second if you use that budget wisely on things like SANS certifications and platform training within 3 years you can be making 100k.  &#x200B;  7: LEARN TO PRESENT and PRESENT YOURSELF (Brush your damn hair...)  If you're showing up to an interview, turn your camera on, brush your hair, wear a button up shirt, present yourself well. I think there's a mindset in InfoSec that you can be a odd ball and do great. Maybe some companies, but I've probably worked and consulted for 100 of the top 500 companies in the US, and do you know how many blue haired people or mohawks I've seen?  Zero...  What you will be paid is strongly correlated to how valuable of systems you will protect. Most hiring managers will judge you on how you present yourself in an interview. I've prob done 30 interviews within the last 3 - 4 weeks from folks on Reddit, and it's amazing that when I turn on my camera people don't turn theirs's on.  &#x200B;  I do hire from Reddit, I've got one team member already who I've hired from here, and I'll likely hire 2 more within the next 2 - 4 weeks. I hope this helps all of you who are interested in getting into the field.  &#x200B;  Best wishes and success to you all.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  EDIT:  I want to make this clear, this post is:  1: For people who are JUST getting into the InfoSec space, there are many more advanced things like container security, but if you don't understand how operating systems work, good luck really understanding containers.  2: I'm not saying I personally hold these opinions, some people were triggered by my hair color / mohawk comment. First, get used to it, there are lots of things in life that are triggering. I do have a project manager on my team who has a mohawk, she's amazing, and a highly valued member of my team.  However, if you're just getting into the industry and you want to absolutely maximize your chances of getting in play the game.  I can share a personal story about a friend of the family.  She was trying to get into web development. My wife met her in a coding boot camp and she was a very good developer. She had a rainbow of color for her hair, and that was on her LinkedIn profile. She applied to 30 places and got zero call backs. She changed her hair color to platinum blond almost white, updated her LinkedIn profile and got a call back the very next week. Now correlation doesn't equal causation but it's a data point. 1, you can either sit and compline and not move forward, 2, you can play the game and get a desired outcome you're looking for, or 3, you can hold out and just work for a company who doesn't care. Option 3 is TOTALLY viable, but it limits your chances.  3: People complained about the PASSION section.  There's a reason why InfoSec as a job has a high turn over / burn out rate; drug and alcohol addition is VERY high in this field. It's a real problem, and it's a real problem because of the stress levels of the job. If you don't really love this field it's going to burn you out, I've seen it, I've lost friends to it.  What compounds this problem is that unlike something like the medical field where you can go to conferences and get explicit training, the InfoSec field (sadly) doesn't treat training the same way. When I got into the field a SANS course was $3900, now they are $7500. There are lots of local conferences, but it's not set training. Lots of conferences are higher level, and not real hands on.  There are so many things about the industry that I do not like, I hate how product / vendor focused it is, I hate how InfoSec leaders don't invest in new talent, but I love helping people solve their problems.  Helping hospitals secure their environments literally saves lives now, and that's a great feeling. You have to have something inside you that keeps you going, this is just my opinion but I've seen it play out a lot this way over the last 20 years.  4: I'm sorry for any typos, this was posted after a long day, and after reviewing a ton of resumes.  &#x200B;
sma92878	Many people have asked me for a cybersecurity learning plan here it is	837	xchx1u	https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/xchx1u/many_people_have_asked_me_for_a_cybersecurity/	83	2022-09-12 16:53:01	cybersecurity	Happy Monday all,  I hadn't really intended to be very active in this community, I try and stay off social media, but over the last year I've interacted with a fairly large number of folks on this sub. Many people have asked me for a training plan. I was working on something similar anyways so I figure I would post my first draft of a learning plan for those who are looking to get into information security.  I'm not saying this is perfect, this is based off the consulting practice I run and the work that we do.  However, I do believe this will be helpful for a great many of you. I've likely spoken via phone, message, or chat with well over 100 people from this sub, and from what I've seen people seem to think there are only two information security jobs:  1. SoC analyst 2. Penetration tester  Don't limit yourself to these choices, there are so many more options out there.  Again I run a consulting practice, so this is my personal view on the world, but I also interface with multiple customers literally on a daily basis.  I talk to roughly 1000 companies a year about their needs and what they are looking for, so I would say I have a fairly good pulse on the industry.  Our customers have a tendency to be larger so this may not be as applicable if you work for a very small company.  I figured I would share my recommended learning path options for folks that are new to the field. I hope this helps some of you.

BitiumRibbon	I teach Grade 8, and I am gay, and today one of the “cool guys” made me cry tears of pride. (x-post from /r/lgbt)	821	1gmj6z	https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1gmj6z/i_teach_grade_8_and_i_am_gay_and_today_one_of_the/	89	2013-06-19 01:25:31	education	Context: I teach Grade 8 (13-14 years old) in Ontario, Canada. I am gay, and my students have known this for about a month or so. I am in my first year of teaching, and I teach something of a tough class.   In particular, I have one group of boys that can be a bit of a pain in the neck. Never keep their hands to themselves, always talk out of turn, have gotten in fights, etc. There is one boy in this group (he will be known here as Harry) who is a little quieter than the others, but very popular. He’s a bit tough to get close to, and seems like the type to be resistant to new ideas and different people. He hangs out with another tough kid (let’s call him Mark), who is loud and boisterous and often rude.  Now that it’s so close to the end of the year, I do a “YouTube of the Day” with them every morning. Kids can send in a short YouTube video for me to show to the class, I preview it, and if it’s appropriate, I play it. So this morning, Harry comes up to me and says, “I have a video I want to play.”  Now, I preview things for a reason. There are enough horror stories out there of teachers accidentally showing their kids porn for me to be very careful what I show my class. So I tell him to send it to me because, y’know, them’s the rules.   “I really want to show it,” he says back. “You’ll like it, I promise. It’s a music video.”  Given what Harry listens to, I’m wary. He listens to a lot of rap and hip-hop, and that’s fine, but I’ve heard some non-school-appropriate language come out of the music he listens to. So I ask him if it’s appropriate for school; he tells me yes.   This kid is many things, but he has never lied to me, that I'm aware of. Not once. So… I take a deep breath and tell him okay. What the heck.   (Note: I did read the lyrics, and they were beautiful, but what came next was unexpectedly awesome.)  So he goes on over and pulls it on up, and on comes a song I have never heard before. The artist is rapping about growing up gay, about the struggles of being gay, and about standing up in the face of hatred and homophobia. “Same Love,” by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. The video (linked) was beautiful.   And there’s Harry, proudly watching along with the rest of the class as the artist stands up for those gay kids who struggle, and the video shows a difficult, lonely life culminating in a fabulous wedding. Harry. My “tough kid.”  The video finishes, the kids applaud, and I thank him, and he says to me, “I told you you’d like it.”  And then his loud, rude friend Mark says: “That was for you, Mr. K.”  The whole class applauded again – for me this time – and then I cried. I cried the proudest tears I have ever shed.   Harry and Mark… they might tick off every teacher they ever have, but today they gave this teacher a moment he’ll never forget.    tl;dr: Tough kid in my class showed a music video whose message is to stand up against homophobia, and the class cheered.  
ReeditVsReadit	My wife is an educator. That’s a lie. She is the only adult some of her students can depend on, she is an advocate for those students with food insecurities, she is a warm hug when the world seems so cold. Please pray for her and all teachers under the government’s “plan” going forward.	689	hvmw91	https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/hvmw91/my_wife_is_an_educator_thats_a_lie_she_is_the/	66	2020-07-22 04:10:48	education

Talking about how students will have to literally sit in a chair all day and practically work alone. They aren't aloud to move around or interact really with other students. And she's so heartbroken. And every comment is just horrible. People are saying suck it up, so you have to teach kids manners? That's what you're for. Like no that's not the point. The point is that teachers WILL NOT be able to provide them with the best learning experience. Students deserve a better experience. The fact that people instantly see that she is just complaining and not actually caring about the kind of education these students will be receiving due to these conditions is just heartbreaking. No one cares. All education is, is glorified childcare apparently.Almost everyone that is not an educator has made that clear. Who cares about the experiences, the support, students having a safe environment to learn about themselves, the opportunities for new experiences, learning how to be successful as well as develop meaningful and even lifelong relationships.  No wonder America is failing.  Edit: To clarify, it is ignorant of me go say Americans. Not all Americans are like this. I was not meaning educators and parents or people that actually care. But it does seem that many don't care about the quality education a student receives and are not empathetic to the reasons of why schools are apprehensive about having in school learning at this time.   Just because we have all been a part of education at some point in our lives does not make us all experts.  And please refrain from being hateful, this is just an opinion that I wanted to discuss with others. If you don't agree, fine. No need to say mean things.

I am a high school teacher. I teach freshman earth science.  Today one of the punks in my class comes up to me and says Ms. XYZ, I'm sorry I haven't been doing my homework, I really cant fail your class.. can I come after school and do my homework in your classroom?  So I say sure, but why cant you do it at home?  Now she gets mad and shuts down and says Forget it and try's to walk away.  I stop her, I say you can tell me whats going on, you wont be in trouble  At this point she breaks down and cries, I was holding her arm so she wouldn't run, and she just collapses into my arms.  After a bit of sobbing she tells me, he mom bailed on her two months ago, she was locked out of the shitty efficiency they where living in, and she has been living in a sketchy homeless shelter for the last month. She doesn't have a flat spot (like a desk, or bed) to do her homework, and if she fails my class the school will kick her out and she wont be able to eat lunches.  WTF world.  Edit: I call her a punk because she dresses like a punk kid from the 90`s.. it was more affection than anything, I was a punk/bad kid and also a high school drop out,  I'm not putting her down.. promise.. I am seriously thinking about bringing her home tomorrow after school with me.  Update: I wasapproved by dhhs to take her in. I have a day to get my apartment kid ready... aka I need a new bed and I'm going to lock up my liquor :-) . I went to the shelter just now to check out her stuff. She has a garbage bag full of clothes and stuff.. I will get her some things to fill in the gaps. I haven't told her yet. I'm taking her out to dinner tonight and breaking the news then. The great thing about my place is I have a huge finished addict, I'm going to convert it to a bedroom for her, so she will have her own bathroom and closet, but she still has to walk right by my room to get out. ...... any advice?   Also, I am female and 25. A few people wondered.  tl.dr. Bad student in my class confesses to being homeless. she is 13.

Despite this, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos continues to call for schools to reopen without providing adequate PPE or other precautions, citing an unfounded claim that “kids are actually stoppers of the disease and they don’t get it and transmit it themselves.”   As of August 20, 442,785 cases of COVID-19 were reported in children.  If it wasn’t already clear before, Betsy DeVos is just another one of Trump’s goons trying to cover up his outrageous mishandling of the ongoing pandemic. When you pledge to vote this year, you’re not just pledging to vote for Biden and his team of progressive activists fighting for your rights. You’re pledging to vote Trump and his goons like Betsy DeVos out of office, too.

No discipline, no respect, I have no control.  I have spent the past week standing in the hall, practicing entering the room multiple times one at a time bc we can't do it correctly, and the rest of the time implementing the individual discipline procedures.  Haven't even had an opportunity to teach.  The kids parents are gangsters and drug dealers.  They have no support or structure at home.  Idk what else to do.... I can't teach, kids are fighting and smacking lips, throwing things at me and talking out and back to me constantly.  I have no break between classes.   I'm ready to give up.  Any suggestions?
b1ackfyre	We need to hold our leaders accountable. At minimum we need a $13,500 raise for every teacher paid for by the federal government, as Harris / Biden promised. Boosting pay in education helps solve the labor supply shortages, attracts talent, and helps keep us from being streched so thin.	327	rw4y93	https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/rw4y93/we_need_to_hold_our_leaders_accountable_at/	86	2022-01-04 21:15:46	education	   Harris promised a [$13,500 raise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E93VjP2UzkM) for every teacher paid for by the federal government on the campaign trail. Biden promised to increase teacher salaries to a [minimum of $60,000](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/biden-teacher-pay-universal-pre-k-1479288) on the campaign trail. Given that the majority of funding for education comes from state budgets, Congress would need to pass a bill and establish a permanent federal funding source dedicated to teacher salaries. Our leaders promised to do this in a pre-pandemic environment. Given labor supply shortages, now more than ever education workers need a raise. Wages have to go up for education to become more functional. It's the only way, especially in this environment. In my area alone, the majority of districts have 10-15% of their positions unfilled.  I'm not sure the exact mechanism to advocate, but we need to petition our leaders to include teacher salary increases, paid for by the federal government, in the blockbuster infrastructure bill they've been batting around for the last 6 months. In all likelihood, this is the only vehicle that Harris / Biden could stay true to their promise.  Write your Congress people, write your local and state union, blow up social media, etc. We need a fucking raise and our national leadership can give us one.

On average, we score poorly. A year or so later they release enough information that we can see the scores for subgroups. This never gets as much publicity. But the results are pretty consistent, American education is doing a great job with what it has to work with. The problem isn't American education, the problem is American poverty.  In [Math](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/pisa2015/pisa2015highlights_5d.asp), our overall average is 470 (40th out of 73), below the [OECD average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment) of 490. But if you look at students in schools with less than 10% free/reduced lunch, their average is 530, good for 7th overall. Our next tier of students, 10-25% free/reduced lunch have an average of 514, putting them 11th overall.  In [Reading](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/pisa2015/pisa2015highlights_4e.asp), our overall average is 497 (24th out of 73), just above the [OECD average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment) of 493. The 10% or less kids score 548, putting them 1st in the world. The 10-25% kids were at 542, also putting them 1st in the world (only behind out 10% or less students). Our 25-50% free/reduced lunch students scored a 515, good for 8th (or 10th if you include our other two groups).  In [Science](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/pisa2015/pisa2015highlights_3e.asp), our overall score is 496 (25th out of 73), just above the [OECD average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment) of 493. The 10% score is 553, 2nd in the world. 10-25% get 546, also 2nd. The 25-50% group has an average of 518, tied for 10th (or 12th if you include our other two groups).  Now these aren't apples to apples comparisons because we aren't breaking out the rich kids in the other countries. But we know that inequality in the US is far greater than inequality in the other countries at the top of the rankings. Those other countries put a lot more effort into mitigating the effects of poverty on children. Their higher and lower SES students do not perform as differently as ours do. When researchers who have access to data from other countries do similar comparisons, they find that our students, at every breakdown of demographics, are at or near the top in every subject.  The problem with American education isn't in American schools or teachers, it is in American communities and families. The problem with American education is American poverty.
