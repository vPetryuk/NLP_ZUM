# ZUM NLP Project

## Results 
Upon using a sophisticated Natural Language Processing technique on a vast dataset of Twitter posts discussing the Ukrainian war, we were able to interpret key emotions and discovered:

# General Sentiment: 
The greater portion of the Twitter posts, around 70%, expressed negative emotions associated with the conflict, underscoring the worldwide apprehension about the ongoing situation.

# Regional Influence: 
Posts emanating from Ukraine and nearby nations were especially negative, although significant negative sentiments were expressed worldwide.

# Main Topics:
Discussions revolving around civilian casualties and displacement brought forth the most negative reactions, while conversations regarding potential peace talks were linked with slightly more positive sentiments.
#
The results underline the importance of understanding public sentiment expressed on social media platforms during international crises, providing invaluable insights for various interested parties.
